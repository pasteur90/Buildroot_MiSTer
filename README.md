# MiSTer Linux Modernization

**A complete, reproducible operating system for the MiSTer DE10-Nano — kernel, root
filesystem, a real-time kernel variant, a flashable SD-card image, and the update channel
that delivers them.** Built in the open from a modern Buildroot and a mainline LTS kernel,
with every MiSTer kernel patch carried in-tree as a plain `.patch` file applied to a
pristine, hash-verified kernel.org tarball.

It is a **drop-in replacement**: the unmodified, stock `MiSTer` binary and every existing
core run on it unchanged. (Since 2026-09-12 that means **Main_MiSTer Release 20260912 or
newer**: the Switch controller's IMU/LED naming fix moved from our kernel to Main_MiSTer
#1307/#1308, so an older `MiSTer` binary on this image sees a phantom IMU pad and dark
Switch player/home LEDs.)

## What ships

| Artifact | What it is |
|---|---|
| `linux.img` + `zImage_dtb` | The OS itself — rootfs and kernel, delivered as a normal update through the **stock on-device Downloader** |
| `zImage_dtb-rt` | A **`PREEMPT_RT` kernel variant**, built by CI. Its modules ride inside the same `linux.img`, so switching kernels is a one-line `u-boot.txt` edit in either direction — no rootfs flash |
| `sdcard.img.xz` | A **complete, flashable SD card** that self-expands to the card's real size on first boot — no mr-fusion, no Windows SD installer |
| `release_YYYYMMDD.7z` | The stock-layout release archive, byte-compatible with the Downloader's expectations |
| `legal-info.tar.gz` | A **full SBOM** — every package, version, license, and upstream source tarball |
| `SHA256SUMS` + attestations | Build provenance for the image assets |
| `db.json` | The **opt-in update channel**, served from GitHub Pages — drop one script into `Scripts/`, run it, and releases arrive through the standard on-device Downloader |
| An exportable kernel tree | The carried series, rendered deterministically into `Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` layout so upstream can consume the work without a second fork |

> **Status — personal use only.** Phases 0–3 are complete with hardware validation on a
> real DE10-Nano; Phase 4 (release engineering & sustainability) is in progress. Nothing
> here will be offered publicly until the sustainability commitment in

## The one-paragraph version

MiSTer's operating system ships as an opaque archive containing a **375 MiB ext4 image**
(93% full) built from **Buildroot 2021.02.4** with **glibc 2.31**, running **Linux
5.15.1** — a kernel forked in November 2021 that **never merged a single 5.15.y stable
release** in the five years it shipped. (On 2026-09-07 stock moved to **6.18.38**, pinned
the same way: one point release, no `.y` updates — see the note under the table below.)
There is no public build recipe, no CI, no SBOM, and no update path for any of it. This project rebuilds the whole thing from **Buildroot 2026.08** and a
**mainline 6.18 LTS kernel** in a public repository, with reproducible builds, a
signed-hash supply chain, a nine-workflow CI pipeline, and a per-commit reconciliation
of the entire kernel fork — then ships it through the same update channel users already
have, alongside a real-time kernel variant and a flashable card image that stock has no
equivalent of. All of it boots the **unmodified, stock `MiSTer` binary** and every
existing core.

The core posture: **prove parity first, then improve.** Carry the smallest possible delta
against a pristine kernel.org tree, and hand each subsystem back to mainline as soon as
mainline can hold it.

## Stock vs. this image, at a glance

| | Stock MiSTer | This project |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel** | 5.15.1 from Nov 2021 to 2026-09-07 with **zero** `5.15.y` stable updates ever merged; **6.18.38 since Release 20260907**, pinned the same way — 12 `6.18.y` releases behind our pin at the time of writing | **6.18 LTS**, on a live `.y` line with security backports |
| **Kernel delta** | 5.15: 110 commits on a squashed-import fork with no shared ancestry with mainline — so no `merge-base`, and no per-commit disposition. 6.18: a fresh ~70-commit re-port onto a squashed `v6.18.38` import, same shape | **38 patch files** against a pristine tarball, each with provenance, upstream status, and an evidence-backed record |
| **Buildroot** | 2021.02.4 — **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`/etc/os-release` `PRETTY_NAME`, both releases) | **2026.08** (~5 years of upstream work) |
| **glibc / gcc** | 2.31 / gcc 10-era — **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`libc.so.6 → libc-2.31.so`; `strings` shows `GNU C Library (GNU) stable release version 2.31`) | **2.44 / 15.3.0** |
| **OpenSSL** | **1.1.1k — EOL since 2023-09-11**, no upstream fixes since; **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`strings usr/lib/libssl.so.1.1`, both releases → `OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021`) | **3.6.4** |
| **OpenSSH** | 8.6p1 — **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`strings usr/sbin/sshd`, both releases → `OpenSSH_8.6p1`) | **10.5p1** |
| **Samba** | 4.14.6 — **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`strings usr/sbin/smbd`, both releases → `SAMBA_4.14.6`) | **4.24.6** |
| **Python** | 3.9.6 — **unchanged by Release 20260907** (`usr/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload/_sysconfigdata__linux_arm-linux-gnueabihf.pyc` embeds `3.9.6`, both releases) | **3.14.7** |
| **SSH host keys** | **Identical on every MiSTer on Earth**, baked into the public download, dated 2016 — **still true in Release 20260907**: byte-identical `ssh_host_*_key.pub` fingerprints to 20250402 | **Generated per device on first boot**, persisted to the FAT card ([ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-per-device-ssh-host-keys.md)) |
| **Timezone on a fresh card** | Unset — `/media/fat/linux/timezone` does not exist, so glibc falls back to **UTC** and stays there until the user finds the community `timezone.sh` script — **still true in Release 20260907**: `/etc/localtime` is still a broken symlink to `/media/fat/linux/timezone` | **Detected once**, from the box's public IP, using the same provider and the same destination file as `timezone.sh` so the two are interchangeable. It is one dhcpcd hook, firing on the first connection the box makes — so a card that was offline on its first boot still gets it once Wi-Fi is set up, and a box with no network does nothing at all. Never overwrites a timezone you set, and it is opt-out-able before it ever runs ([ADR 0025](docs/decisions/0025-first-boot-timezone-autodetect.md)) |
| **Wi-Fi chipset coverage** | 5.15 (until 2026-09-07): six out-of-tree vendor forks, plus in-kernel `mac80211` USB drivers for MediaTek/Ralink/Marvell/older Realtek; no Broadcom, no Wi-Fi 6/6E, no Atheros USB Wi-Fi, no Redpine; several chips can't do WPA3 at all. **6.18 (since Release 20260907): all six out-of-tree forks dropped** in favour of mainline `rtw88`/`rtw89`/`rtl8xxxu`/`mt76`/`ath*` — a real expansion (RTL8812AU/8814AU/8822BU/8822CU/8723DU, **RTL8851BU/8852BU Wi-Fi 6, MT7921U/MT7925U Wi-Fi 6/7 with firmware, RTL8192DU** newly covered) — but **still no Broadcom/Cypress**, still no RTL8852CU/8832CU Wi-Fi 6E, and `rtw88_8821au` (RTL8811AU/8821AU) is still unbuilt (`evidence/stock-20260907-modules.txt`; full per-chip breakdown in the [hardware table](#wi-fi-and-bluetooth-hardware-support)) | **Mainline-first**: in-kernel `mac80211` (`rtl8xxxu`/`rtw88`/`rtw89`/`mt76`/`ath9k_htc`/`rsi`…) for every chip mainline can drive *that is worth building here* — six symbols are deliberately left off (one upstream itself calls non-working, four 2000s-era 802.11b/g parts, one that is optical LiFi rather than Wi-Fi; [`wifi-parity` §7](docs/wifi-parity.md)) — plus Broadcom/Cypress and Wi-Fi 6E support stock still does not have. **One** out-of-tree driver remains, for a Wi-Fi 6E chip mainline has no USB driver for at all. **WPA3/SAE hardware-verified**; see the [hardware-support table](#wi-fi-and-bluetooth-hardware-support) for the full build- vs. hardware-verified breakdown ([ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-mainline-first-wifi-drivers.md)) |
| **Bluetooth firmware** | 5.15 (until 2026-09-07): `ath3k` shipped with **no `ath3k-1.fw` and no `ar3k/*.dfu` at all**; no MediaTek MT79xx and no Qualcomm QCA firmware (its Realtek combos *were* covered). **6.18 (since Release 20260907): still no `ath3k-1.fw`/`ar3k/*.dfu`, still no Qualcomm QCA BT rampatch, Realtek combos still covered — but stock now ships one Broadcom `.hcd`** (`brcm/BCM20702A1-0b05-17cb.hcd`, new in this release) and the **Wi-Fi-side** MT7961/MT7925 patch/RAM-code blobs (no `BT_`-prefixed MediaTek blob appears, so the Bluetooth side of that combo is not evidently covered) (`evidence/stock-20260907-firmware.txt`) | Firmware audited driver-by-driver against what each one actually requests at runtime, gaps closed (MediaTek combo, Qualcomm QCA Rome USB, one Broadcom `.hcd`, Atheros AR3011/AR3012) — **including one asymmetry this project itself introduced**: we shipped the MT7961 *Wi-Fi* blob without its *Bluetooth* sibling, so that combo dongle's Wi-Fi worked and its BT did not. Found and closed. Two built drivers still ship with **no** firmware, deliberately and on the record ([`bluetooth-parity` §9](docs/bluetooth-parity.md)) |
| **The `.7z` extractor that unpacks every OS update** | **p7zip 16.02 — dated 2016-05-21**, in *two* places: `usr/bin/7zr` in the rootfs, and `/media/fat/linux/7za`, which the Downloader **downloads off the internet** the first time it updates and then reuses forever. **Unchanged by Release 20260907** (`strings usr/bin/7zr`, both releases → `7-Zip (a) [32] 16.02`) | **7-Zip 26.03**, built from source in-tree. The `/media/fat/linux/7za` copy is shipped by us — **statically linked**, so it survives a rollback to an older or even stock rootfs — so that download never happens ([ADR 0023](docs/decisions/0023-ship-7zip-instead-of-fetching-p7zip-16.md)) |
| **NTFS** | Not supported at all | `ntfs3` in-kernel module + `ntfs-3g` automount |
| **Image size** | 375 MiB — **13.6% free** ("93% full") on `release_20250402`, **6.3% free** on `release_20260907`, whose 6.18 module set (+21 MB) and larger firmware set (+7 MB) consumed another 29 MB of the same fixed image ([`stock-release-20260907` §1](docs/verification/stock-release-20260907.md)) | 512 MiB, **39.5% free** — 310 MiB used / 202 MiB free, temporary debug block included, measured by `./scripts/check-size-budget.sh output/images/linux.img` on the image built 2026-07-27 **with** this branch's full package set (the T5 utilities, 7-Zip, and the rtl8852cu driver all included). Floor is 15%. ⚠️ [`docs/size-budget.md`](docs/size-budget.md) still reports 60.6% free: it is a P3.3-vintage report and needs regenerating |
| **Rootfs build recipe** | **Not published.** `MiSTer-devel/Linux_Image_creator_MiSTer` exists, but it is an *assembler*, not a builder: `create_img.sh` runs `mkfs.ext4` and untars a prebuilt **82 MiB `rootfs.tar.bz2` committed to git**. Nothing public turns source into that tarball, so the image can be re-packed but its contents cannot be changed, patched or audited beyond `ls` | This repository |
| **Reproducible** | No published recipe, so unverifiable | **Byte-identical across independent builds**, proven by CI ([`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md)) |
| **SBOM / license manifest** | None published | Full `legal-info` bundle published with every release |
| **Dependency updates** | Manual, ad-hoc | **Renovate**, covering kernel pins, firmware, and every package hash |
| **Real-time kernel** | No | **`PREEMPT_RT` variant** built by CI, booted on hardware |

Every number in that table is sourced. The versions come from the *shipped artifacts* on
both sides — stock from the extracted stock `linux.img`, ours read off the built tree.

**Stock moved on 2026-09-07 — re-measured 2026-09-10.** Release 20260907 replaced stock's
kernel (5.15.1 → 6.18.38, a fresh port on upstream's `MiSTer-v6.18` branch), its module set
(89 modules, up from 52 — the six out-of-tree Wi-Fi forks are gone in favour of the same
mainline drivers this image uses) and its firmware set (91 files, up from 66). The rootfs
side (`rootfs.tar.bz2`) was extracted and overlaid with `modules.tar.gz` / `firmware.tar.gz`
/ `addon.tar` exactly as the release's own `create_img.sh` does, then measured with
`scripts/inventory/`, per
[`fork-sync-2026-09/PLAN.md` §9.2](docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/PLAN.md) — full
output in [`docs/stock-inventory/20260907/`](docs/stock-inventory/20260907/) (`busybox`'s
applet list excepted — no `qemu-arm` in the authoring session, version string only). Every
cell in the table above and the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth hardware tables below is now the 20260907
measurement, each citing how; where a cell says "unchanged" that is a fresh comparison, not
an old number left standing — **the entire Buildroot userland outside the kernel/modules/
firmware turned out to be byte-for-byte unchanged** (same Buildroot/glibc/OpenSSL/OpenSSH/
Samba/Python/p7zip versions, same 507 true-ABI shared libraries). The one thing still
unmeasured is **Image size**: the release ships tarballs, not a formatted `linux.img`, and
this pass did not run `create_img.sh` + `mkfs.ext4` to produce one — see that row. The
kernel patch reconciliation described in §1 was performed against the 5.15 fork; the first
increment against stock's 6.18 branch is [`fork-sync-2026-09/`](docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/),
executed separately from this rootfs-side re-measurement.

**On version drift, since this table cites documents that can lag it.** The ground truth
for "ours" is always the build pins — `BUILDROOT_VERSION` in the `Makefile` and
`configs/mister_de10nano_defconfig` and the profiles it enables under `package/mister-*/` — plus whatever Buildroot's own `.mk` files resolve
to at that pin. The documents below are **dated analyses**, not a live mirror of those
pins: a Renovate bump or a Buildroot line bump moves a package without rewriting the
prose that reasoned about it. Where a document is behind the pin it now says so at the
top, and lists what has and has not been re-checked. **Nothing in CI asserts package
versions**, so that gap is closed by reading, not by a test — see
[the honest list](#what-is-not-better--the-honest-list).

Full detail with citations: [`docs/version-delta.md`](docs/version-delta.md) (the stack,
re-read most recently), [`docs/package-manifest.md`](docs/package-manifest.md) (the
251-SONAME mapping, established against Buildroot 2026.02.3),
[`docs/verification/stock-release-20250402.md`](docs/verification/stock-release-20250402.md)
(the stock side as this table was written against) and
[`docs/verification/stock-release-20260907.md`](docs/verification/stock-release-20260907.md)
(stock **did** move in 2026-09: a 6.18.38 kernel on the same 2021 userland — that
document records what changed and which rows here it dates).

## Project status

| Phase | State | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Recon & decisions** | ✅ Complete | Patch triage, ABI-contract verification, five open questions decided (ADRs 0010–0014) |
| **1 — Kernel & initramfs** | ✅ Complete | 6.18 LTS pinned; all 38 patches apply cleanly (40/40 re-measured 2026-09-11 at `patch -p1 -F0`, zero fuzz; `0040`/`0041` retired 2026-09-12 and the surviving hid-nintendo stack re-measured 7/7 on 6.18.51); `zImage_dtb` builds warning-free, boots under QEMU **and on real hardware** — from the **CI-built artifact**, not a local build |
| **2 — Rootfs & testing** | ✅ Complete | Buildroot 2026.08, glibc 2.44, reproducible ext4 image with full SBOM; menu and cores load on hardware — the ABI contract holds *in practice*, not just on paper |
| **3 — Module packages & HW matrix** | ✅ Complete | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, controllers and special devices packaged; hardware-validated **for the chips actually present on the one test board**. The v10/v10.1/v10.2 driver + firmware expansion (Broadcom, Wi-Fi 6/6E, MediaTek, Atheros USB, Redpine) is packaged and mostly CI-asserted but **not** hardware-validated — see the [ledger](#hardware-validation-ledger) and the [chipset table](#wi-fi-and-bluetooth-hardware-support). The remaining matrix rows (Samba, MIDI) are build/CI-verified only |
| **4 — Release & sustainability** | 🔄 In progress | CI/CD, `db.json` distribution, beta program, governance, publication gate |
| **5 — Full SD image & U-Boot** | 🔄 Partially landed | `sdcard.img` builds, and `release.yml` verifies it with `scripts/check-sdcard.sh` ([ADR 0020](docs/decisions/0020-sdcard-exfat-reformat-installer.md)); U-Boot from source is now building on every DE10 build, **mainline 2026.07**, ships nowhere ([ADR 0024](docs/decisions/0024-mainline-uboot-capability-artifact.md), [plan](docs/uboot-mainline-port.md), [tasks](docs/uboot-tasks.md), [verification](docs/verification/uboot-mainline.md)) — and the SD image has not been flashed to a fresh card on hardware (P5.4) |

### Hardware validation ledger

Validated on **one real DE10-Nano**, booting CI-built artifacts:

| Subsystem | Status |
|---|---|
| Boot to MiSTer menu, cores load | ✅ Confirmed |
| All out-of-tree modules present, no BUG/Oops/panic | ✅ Confirmed |
| Bluetooth — firmware load + controller pairing | ✅ Confirmed |
| Wi-Fi — **WPA3/SAE (PMF required)** 5 GHz auto-connect via mainline `rtw88` | ✅ Confirmed |
| Downloader over HTTPS | ✅ Confirmed |
| **`PREEMPT_RT` kernel boots and runs MiSTer** | ✅ Confirmed on **7.2-rc4** (2026-07-20) and **7.2-rc7** (2026-08-14). The pin has since moved to **7.2 final**, which builds green (`make linux-rt`, 2026-08-17) but has **not been booted** — boot is a per-version claim |
| Samba, MIDI | ⚠️ Build/CI-verified only — **not** exercised on hardware |
| RT latency measurement | ⏳ Not yet taken |

Test logs live in [`docs/testlogs/`](docs/testlogs/). Anything not listed above should be
treated as unverified in practice — that includes most of the
[Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chipset table](#wi-fi-and-bluetooth-hardware-support) below: this ledger's
"all out-of-tree modules present" row is a snapshot from **before** the current branch's
driver/firmware expansion (Broadcom, Wi-Fi 6/6E, and the rest), which has not yet had its
own hardware pass.

<a id="install-it-on-a-real-mister"></a>
## Install it on a real MiSTer

**One command, on the MiSTer itself, over SSH.** This converts an ordinary install —
including one flashed with Mr. Fusion — to this image. It works on a stock card; you do
not need to reflash anything.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcfbytes/Buildroot_MiSTer/master/install.sh | bash
```

<a id="if-the-one-liner-seems-to-do-nothing"></a>
> **On a stock card the one-liner above will fail, and fail quietly.** Verified on real
> hardware: stock's `curl` cannot verify GitHub (`curl: (60)`), `bash` gets an empty pipe,
> and the pipeline still **exits 0** — so it looks like nothing happened at all.
>
> The cause is not an expired bundle. Stock ships exactly one file in `/etc/ssl/certs/`,
> `cacert.pem`, and it works fine — it simply is not in the hashed-symlink layout curl
> searches by default, so curl finds no issuer. Passing `--cacert` explicitly fixes it,
> which is what `Scripts/update.sh` has always done.
>
> So fetch the installer with `-k` for that one request and let it take over — it detects
> this, **verifies the card's own bundle actually works before adopting it**, and uses it
> for everything afterwards:
>
> ```sh
> curl -fsSLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcfbytes/Buildroot_MiSTer/master/install.sh -o /tmp/mlm.sh \
>   && sh /tmp/mlm.sh
> ```
>
> If you would rather not use `-k` at all, download `install.sh` on a machine whose TLS
> works, check its `sha256sum` against the repo, and copy it onto the card. And if a card
> ever turns up whose bundle is genuinely broken rather than merely mislocated,
> `install.sh --bootstrap-ca` fetches a fresh one to `/tmp` for a single run — it explains
> that trade-off in full before doing anything.
>
> You only need any of this once: this image ships a current CA bundle in the layout curl
> expects, and refreshes it on every release.
>
> **`wget` is not an alternative.** The `wget` on a MiSTer is the BusyBox applet with no
> TLS support at all — it answers every `https://` URL with `not an http or ftp url`.
> Stock ships a real `curl`, and MiSTer's own `update.sh` uses it exclusively.

Prefer to read before you run — the better habit, and this script is written to be read:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcfbytes/Buildroot_MiSTer/master/install.sh -o mlm.sh
less mlm.sh
sh mlm.sh --dry-run     # prints exactly what it would change, touches nothing
```

`--dry-run` prints the full plan and exits. `--yes` skips the 10-second countdown,
`--no-reboot` leaves the reboot to you.

> **Read [`docs/user/beta-testing.md`](docs/user/beta-testing.md) first.** This is a
> personal project with an unmet sustainability gate ([ADR 0014](docs/decisions/0014-sustainability-deferred-not-waived.md)),
> validated on one board. The ledger directly above is the honest account of what has and
> has not been tested on hardware.

### What it changes

The installer prints all of this and pauses before doing anything.

| | |
|---|---|
| `linux/linux.img`, `linux/zImage_dtb` | **Replaced** — the root filesystem and kernel. This is the point |
| `linux/7za` | **Replaced** — 7-Zip 26.03 instead of the 2016 p7zip |
| `downloader.ini` | **One key changed:** `[MiSTer] update_linux = false`. A surgical edit; your comments, sections and databases are left alone, and the original is saved to `linux/.mlm-backup/downloader.ini.orig`. Created (declaring the official database) only if you don't have one |
| `Scripts/update_linux_modernization.sh` | **Installed** — this is what updates the image from now on |
| `Scripts/check_storage.sh`, `Scripts/pair_logitech.sh` | **Installed** — two small launchers for tools that live in the image ([exFAT check](docs/decisions/0026-user-driven-exfat-fsck.md), [Logitech pairing](docs/logitech-pairing.md)) |

**Everything else under `linux/` is rewritten with byte-identical content.** Our release
archive *is* the stock archive with those three files swapped in, so `MidiLink.INI`,
`ppp_options`, `uboot.img`, `updateboot`, the `_`-prefixed templates, `mt32-rom-data/` and
`soundfonts/` come back exactly as they were. It is a no-op unless you had customised one
— and the small ones are copied to `linux/.mlm-backup/` first in case you had.

Two side effects, both caused by *any* Linux update rather than by this one: the saved
U-Boot environment (first 512 bytes of the card) is wiped by `updateboot`, and SSH host
keys change, because this image generates them per device instead of shipping one set to
everybody ([ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-per-device-ssh-host-keys.md)) — expect a
one-time host-key warning.

**Afterwards, routine updates stop touching `/media/fat/linux/` altogether.**
`update_linux = false` means no Linux update runs unless you run the updater, so these
files end up *more* stable than on stock, where every official Linux update rewrites them.

### What it leaves alone

- **`MiSTer.ini` and every core `.ini` — not touched.** Nor `games/`, ROMs, saves, states,
  `config/`, cores or `_Arcade/`.
- **`linux/gamecontrollerdb/`** — explicitly excluded from the sync.
- **Your live `u-boot.txt`** (holds this card's MAC), **`wpa_supplicant.conf`**,
  **`user-startup.sh`**, **`samba.sh`** — only the `_`-prefixed templates ship, so the real
  ones survive.
- **`linux/{hostname,hosts,interfaces,resolv.conf,dhcpcd.conf,fstab}`** — copied *into* the
  new image before it goes live, so your network identity carries over.

### Afterwards

Your cores keep updating normally — `update_all.sh` and `Scripts/update.sh` simply stop
touching the Linux image, in either direction. That is what stops the official image
overwriting this one; see [ADR 0025](docs/decisions/0025-update-linux-kill-switch-and-private-updater.md).
Updating *this* image is one deliberate action:

```sh
/media/fat/Scripts/update_linux_modernization.sh            # update
/media/fat/Scripts/update_linux_modernization.sh --status   # where am I?
```

**To undo, at any time:** `update_linux_modernization.sh --restore-stock`, then run your
normal update. Full procedure in [`docs/user/rollback.md`](docs/user/rollback.md).

### The other two ways in

- **A fresh card:** flash `sdcard.img.xz` from a [release](https://github.com/mcfbytes/Buildroot_MiSTer/releases).
  It self-expands on first boot and arrives already configured, with Jotego's cores
  enabled. See [`docs/user/sdcard-flashing.md`](docs/user/sdcard-flashing.md).
- **By hand:** [`docs/user/onboarding.md`](docs/user/onboarding.md) walks through the same
  steps individually, if you would rather not run an installer at all.

### On `curl | bash`

You are piping a remote script into a shell as root, which is worth a moment's thought.
It is the same trust model MiSTer's own `Scripts/update.sh` already uses — it fetches
`dont_download.sh` from `raw.githubusercontent.com` and executes it — and the anchor is
HTTPS to GitHub. The installer does **not** pin a hash of the updater it downloads: both
come from the same repository over the same TLS connection, so a pin would add no real
assurance while guaranteeing the file goes stale. If that trade isn't one you want to
make, use the download-and-read form above, or the by-hand route.

## What this improves

### 1. The kernel: five years of stable releases, and a way back to mainline

Stock forked Linux 5.15.1 in November 2021 and **never took a single subsequent 5.15.y
stable release** before replacing it, on 2026-09-07, with 6.18.38 — pinned at that one
point release in exactly the same way, so the pattern is the fork's, not 5.15's. This project tracks
**6.18 LTS** — the exact patch level is
`BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE` in `configs/mister_de10nano_defconfig`,
and it is deliberately not repeated in prose here because stable `.y` releases
land weekly. Pinned by version *and* SHA-256 against kernel.org, with
Renovate opening a PR on every `.y` bump.

The interesting part is not the version number — it's the **shape of the delta**. The
fork's **136 reconciled commits** (110 on the `MiSTer-v5.15` branch stock shipped until
2026-09-07, 10 on upstream's own `MiSTer-v6.18` branch — which stock ships *now* — one
still-open pull-request head carried ahead of its merge, plus 15 residue commits that
existed only on the older v5.14/v5.13.12 branches) are down to **40 carried patch
files**. The bulk of that reconciliation was performed against the **5.15** stock kernel
and left **36** files; the nine commits and one open PR stock's 6.18 branch has taken
since have now been reconciled too — executed, not just planned — in
[`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09.md`](docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09.md)
(plan: [`fork-sync-2026-09/PLAN.md`](docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/PLAN.md)),
adding `0048` (Stadia-FF device IDs), `0049` (an 8BitDo adapter fix carried ahead of its
upstream PR merging) and `0050` (an exFAT read-ahead plug, 6.18-series only); on
2026-09-12 `0040`/`0041` (Switch IMU and LED names) were retired when upstream chose the
Main_MiSTer-side fix instead, and on 2026-09-14 `0051` was added — a revert of a stable
commit `6.18.52` cherry-picked without the commit it repairs, which breaks the `perf` build,
and on 2026-09-21 `0052`/`0053` (an SD-card data-timeout hook and an exFAT directory-scan
read-ahead bound) were added (36 + 3 − 2 + `0051` + 2 = 40). Every
remaining drop is either verifiably in mainline 6.18, replaced by a maintained package,
or recorded as a deliberate decision. `0047` was never part of that delta — it backported
a mainline commit (`ce21a5cf3d1f`, first released in 7.2) that the 6.18.y line had not
received — and it was carried from 2026-08-24 until 2026-09-21, when `6.18.53` took the
same commit as a stable backport and the patch was deleted, as its own header said it
would be.

**Every commit in the fork was independently reconciled**, each with a machine-readable,
evidence-backed disposition record, **100% of them verified by a second independent
review pass** ([`docs/kernel-recon/`](docs/kernel-recon/)). That reconciliation caught and
closed several silent gaps the original triage had misclassified — Joy-Con combining, the
DualSense player-ID and mic-mute/`BTN_Z` interfaces, stock NES/Famicom A/B button mapping,
Pro-Controller-clone tolerance, fake-CSR Bluetooth dongle detection, and two config drifts
(macvlan, `xpad`-as-module) — now carried as patches `0032`–`0037` plus config parity.

Because the kernel is *stored* as `{pinned tarball + ordered series}` rather than as a
materialized tree, [`scripts/export-kernel-tree.sh`](scripts/export-kernel-tree.sh) can
render it back into a `Linux-Kernel_MiSTer`-style git tree deterministically — the export
is a **build output**, not a second source of truth, so upstream can consume the work
without this repo forking the kernel a second time. A separate
`linux-patches-upstream/` series carries what that exported tree needs but our image
deliberately does not (the `loop=` boot patch — see below).

### 2. Six latent bugs found and fixed

These are **not** forward-porting regressions. Every one is present verbatim in the 5.15
fork, and therefore in **every MiSTer image shipped to date**. They surfaced only because
forward-porting forces you to actually read code that has been copied forward untouched
since 2021.

| | Where | The bug | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B1** | GameCube adapter | **Use-after-free on unplug.** Teardown cancels the rumble work item but never the four per-port `work_connect` items, then `kfree()`s the adapter the handler `container_of()`s back into. Same defect on the probe error path. | ✅ Fixed |
| **B2** | `MiSTer_fb` | **`memremap()` returns `NULL` on failure, not an `ERR_PTR`** — the code tests `IS_ERR()`, which is false for NULL, so a failed mapping falls through with `screen_base` unset. Oops on the first fbcon draw. | ✅ Fixed |
| **B3** | MiSTer audio SPI | `class_create()`/`device_create()` return `ERR_PTR`, never `NULL` — so the `== NULL` checks are dead code and a *failed* `device_create()` was treated as success. | ✅ Fixed |
| **B4** | MiSTer audio SPI | Bogus diagnostics on SPI failure: the ring length is computed from a `-1` read, so the status string you read to diagnose a broken SPI link is itself wrong — precisely when you need it. | ✅ Fixed |
| **B5** | Logitech K400 Fn | The fork's own patch reuses `SetFeature` at the wrong feature index, writing the wrong HID++ feature. | ✅ Fixed |
| **B6** | Cyclone V cpufreq | `wait_for_fsm()` passes a *mask* where `wait_on_bit()` wants a *bit number*, so it polls bit 1 instead of bit 0 — and does a plain `test_bit()` on `__iomem`. Harmless today only because the call returns immediately. | ⚠️ **Carried verbatim, deliberately** |

B6 is not fixed on purpose: making it actually *wait* changes the timing of a live PLL
reprogramming sequence, and a forward-port is the wrong place to smuggle in an untested
change to clock sequencing. It is recorded, not hidden.

Notably, **all six live in MiSTer-original or fork-modified code. None is in mainline
code.** That is the sharpest argument for the small-delta posture this project takes.

Full write-up with the reasoning for each: [`docs/patch-provenance.md` §10](docs/patch-provenance.md).

### 3. Security posture

- **OpenSSL 1.1.1 → 3.6.4.** Stock ships a TLS library that has been **end-of-life since
  2023-09-11** and has received no upstream fixes since. This is the single strongest
  security argument for the whole project, and it is a plain, checkable fact.
- **Per-device SSH host keys.** Every stock MiSTer ships the *same* host keys, baked into
  the public release archive, dated 2016-12-31, on a read-only root that makes
  `ssh-keygen -A` a no-op. The private host key of every MiSTer on Earth is public and
  identical — so SSH server impersonation is trivial and produces **no host-key warning**.
  This image generates unique keys on first boot and persists them to an ext4 image on the
  FAT partition, **reusing stock's own proven mechanism** for Bluetooth pairing keys.
  ([ADR 0015](docs/decisions/0015-per-device-ssh-host-keys.md))
- **SSH key login that survives an update.** An OS update replaces `linux.img` wholesale,
  and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` — the usual place for a key — lives inside it, so every
  update discards it. (The root filesystem is read-only at boot and only becomes writable
  once you log in, so putting a key there also means logging in first, which is circular
  when the key *is* the login method.) `sshd` here also
  reads **`/media/fat/config/authorized_keys`**, on the exFAT partition an update never
  touches: drop your `.pub` file there from any PC with a card reader and key login keeps
  working across every future update. No shell access, no script to edit, and
  `StrictModes` stays on — the initramfs mounts that partition `fmask=0022,dmask=0022`,
  which is exactly what `sshd` requires. That is the same file
  [`security_fixes.sh`](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Scripts_MiSTer) has read since
  2021, so a key set up for stock already works here — the difference is that stock
  copies it *into* `linux.img` and so needs the script re-run after every update, while
  this image reads it in place. ([FAQ](docs/user/faq.md#ssh-key-persist))
- **OpenSSH 8.6p1 → 10.5p1**, **Samba ~4.14 → 4.24.6**, **BlueZ → 5.86**,
  **wpa_supplicant 2.9 → 2.12** — the network-facing surface, several release cycles of
  hardening each.
- **Python 3.9 → 3.14.7** — the on-device interpreter that runs the Downloader and
  community scripts (compatibility tested; see [`docs/python-compat.md`](docs/python-compat.md)).
- **An actual update path.** Renovate tracks the kernel, firmware, and every pinned
  package; CI proves each bump still builds and still passes the parity suite. Stock's
  security model is "the image is frozen."

What has *not* changed: **the root password is still `1`**, deliberately, for stock
parity. That is publicly known and always has been. See
[the FAQ](docs/user/faq.md#whats-the-default-root-password-and-is-that-a-problem) for the
plain-language version of what that means on an untrusted network.

### 4. Storage, filesystems, and networking

| Capability | Stock | Here |
|---|---|---|
| **exFAT** | Out-of-tree Samsung driver (also handled FAT12/16/32) | **Mainline `exfat`**, with the Samsung symlink extension carried as patch `0031` ([ADR 0010](docs/decisions/0010-drop-out-of-tree-exfat.md), [ADR 0019](docs/decisions/0019-exfat-symlinks-carried-patch.md)) |
| **exFAT repair** | None. exFAT has no journal, the card is never cleanly unmounted (even the OSD's "Reboot" is a raw HPS reset-controller write), so lost clusters accumulate and nothing ever checks | **Scripts > check_storage.sh** — a read-only scan while running, and, only if it finds something and you confirm, a one-shot `fsck.exfat` on the next boot from the initramfs, the only place a repair can run ([ADR 0026](docs/decisions/0026-user-driven-exfat-fsck.md)) |
| **Logitech pairing** | None. `hid-logitech-dj` drives every *already-paired* device, but the pairing handshake has no kernel interface, so a replacement or second-hand Unifying receiver cannot be bound to a device on-box at all | **Scripts > pair_logitech.sh** — enumerates every receiver, refuses the families it cannot drive (Bolt, Lightspeed) by name, and confirms the result from the receiver's own slot table ([`docs/logitech-pairing.md`](docs/logitech-pairing.md)) |
| **NTFS** | Not supported | `ntfs3` module + `ntfs-3g` automount via util-linux `mount` ([ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-ntfs3-and-all-ext4-variant.md)) |
| **USB automount** | Debian `usbmount` 0.0.24 | Buildroot `usbmount`, functionally identical, **plus NTFS** ([`docs/usb-automount-parity.md`](docs/usb-automount-parity.md)) |
| **Archive extraction** | `7zr` = p7zip 16.02 (2016); the updater additionally fetches the same 2016 build over the network as `/media/fat/linux/7za` | **7-Zip 26.03** as `7zz` (+`7za`), and a static copy shipped to `/media/fat/linux/7za` so nothing is fetched ([ADR 0023](docs/decisions/0023-ship-7zip-instead-of-fetching-p7zip-16.md)) |
| **CIFS kernel mounts** | No `mount.cifs` shipped | `cifs-utils` included — a deliberate, documented **beyond-parity** addition for community storage scripts ([`docs/netfs-parity.md`](docs/netfs-parity.md)) |
| **BitTorrent** | `rtorrent` + `libtorrent.so.21` — a foreground TUI client, started by hand, with a **full DHT but no Local Peer Discovery at all** | `transmission-daemon` + `transmission-remote`, **off until you `mkdir /media/fat/linux/transmission`**: LPD, DHT, PEX and per-file selection, state on the card so an update never destroys it, RPC on loopback only and no UPnP port mapping ([`docs/bittorrent.md`](docs/bittorrent.md)) |
| **Wi-Fi** | Six out-of-tree vendor forks *plus* in-kernel `mac80211` USB drivers for MediaTek/Ralink/Marvell/older Realtek; no Broadcom, no Wi-Fi 6/6E, no Atheros USB Wi-Fi, no Redpine | Mainline drivers for every chip mainline can drive that is worth building here (six symbols deliberately left off — see below), plus chipset families stock never supported at all. **One** out-of-tree driver left — see below |

### Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hardware support

The short version: **if your dongle is Realtek, Broadcom/Cypress, MediaTek,
Atheros/Qualcomm, or Redpine, a driver for it is almost certainly built into
this image** — with **two** named exceptions, both called out below: the newest
Realtek Wi-Fi 6E chip (RTL8852CU — a driver is in the tree, but it is not even
build-verified yet) and Qualcomm/Atheros QCA9377 over USB (no driver built at
all, deliberately, because upstream says its own driver does not work).

Stock's *out-of-tree* set was six Realtek chips, each via its own vendor fork —
but that was not all it had: it also carried in-kernel `mac80211` USB drivers
for MediaTek (`mt7601u`, `mt76x0u`, `mt76x2u`, `mt7663u`), Ralink (`rt2500usb`,
`rt73usb`, `rt2800usb`), Marvell (`mwifiex_usb`, `libertas`/`usb8xxx`) and
older Realtek parts (`rtl8xxxu`, `rtl8192cu`, `rtl8187`), per
[`stock-mods.txt`](docs/verification/stock-reconciliation/stock-mods-20250402.txt).
What it had **none** of was Broadcom, Wi-Fi 6/6E, Atheros USB Wi-Fi, or Redpine — and
for at least one chip it *did* have a driver for, it shipped no firmware, so
the driver probed and then failed (MT7663U; same story for `ath3k` on the
Bluetooth side).

Getting there was a from-scratch, 36-symbol audit of
every USB Wi-Fi driver Linux 6.18 offers, cross-checked against every USB
device-ID table in `drivers/net/wireless/` so the answer is evidence, not
recollection ([`docs/wifi-parity.md` §7](docs/wifi-parity.md)), plus the same
method applied a second time to Bluetooth firmware
([`docs/bluetooth-parity.md` §9](docs/bluetooth-parity.md)).

**Read the last column before the rest — it says how far each row was
actually checked**, and most of this table is newly added, unreleased
hardware support that has not yet had a device plugged into it. The **Stock MiSTer**
column below shows **both** eras: the 5.15 image (release 20250402, stock until
2026-09-07) and 6.18 (Release 20260907, re-measured 2026-09-10 against the extracted
`rootfs.tar.bz2` + `modules.tar.gz` + `firmware.tar.gz` overlay — see
[`docs/stock-inventory/20260907/`](docs/stock-inventory/20260907/) and
[`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/evidence/`](docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/evidence/)).
Stock's 6.18 kernel dropped every out-of-tree Wi-Fi fork for mainline `rtw88`/`rtw89`/
`rtl8xxxu`/`mt76`, and it is a genuine expansion in several rows below — this is a
module/firmware **presence** check only, the same "build-verified, not hardware-verified"
caveat that applies to most of *this* image's own rows applies doubly to stock's, since
nobody here has stock hardware to pair against:

| If your dongle uses… | Stock MiSTer | This image | Checked how far? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Realtek 802.11n/ac — RTL8188EU/8188FU, RTL8710BU, RTL8811AU/8821AU, RTL8812AU, RTL8814AU, RTL8821CU, RTL8822BU/8822CU, RTL8723DU | **5.15:** out-of-tree vendor fork for **six** of them (RTL8188EU, RTL8188FU, RTL8811AU/8821AU, RTL8812AU, RTL8821CU, RTL8822BU — [ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-mainline-first-wifi-drivers.md), `stock-mods.txt`); several of those can't do WPA3 at all. **No driver at all** for RTL8710BU, RTL8814AU, RTL8822CU, RTL8723DU. **6.18 (20260907):** mainline `rtl8xxxu` covers RTL8188EU; mainline `rtw88` newly *builds* **RTL8812AU, RTL8814AU, RTL8821CU, RTL8822BU, RTL8822CU, RTL8723DU** (`rtw88_8812au`/`8814au`/`8821c`/`8821cu`/`8822bu`/`8822cu`/`8723du` all present — but see the firmware caveat below: only 8812AU, 8821CU and 8822BU have their blob). **Still no driver** for RTL8811AU/8821AU (**no `rtw88_8821au.ko`** — explicitly absent, even though the firmware `rtw88/rtw8821a_fw.bin` ships). **RTL8710BU and RTL8188FU *are* covered** in 6.18, by `rtl8xxxu.ko` (present): 6.18's `rtl8xxxu` links `8188f.o` and `8710b.o` unconditionally (`drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl8xxxu/Makefile`), binds both outside the `RTL8XXXU_UNTESTED` guard (`core.c:8060-8062`, `:8108-8112`), and stock ships `rtlwifi/rtl8188fufw.bin` + `rtl8710bufw_{SMIC,UMC}.bin`. Three of the newly-built `rtw88` modules ship **without their firmware**, so they load and then fail at `request_firmware()` the way `mt7663u` does: `rtw88/rtw8814a_fw.bin`, `rtw8822c_fw.bin` and `rtw8723d_fw.bin` are all absent from stock's set (`evidence/stock-20260907-{modules,firmware}.txt`; corrected by the Wave-4 audit 2026-09-11) | In-kernel `rtl8xxxu` / `rtw88` (`mac80211`) | **Hardware-verified**: an RTL8822BU auto-connects to a WPA3-only 5 GHz network at boot. (The fork it replaced advertised SAE but failed WPA3-only association with `status_code=1` — hardware-verified regression the switch fixed, [ADR 0016](docs/decisions/0016-mainline-first-wifi-drivers.md).) Every other chip in this row builds the same way but has **not** been tested against real hardware. |
| Realtek Wi-Fi 6 — RTL8851BU, RTL8852BU | **5.15:** not supported. **6.18 (20260907):** now built — `rtw89_8851b`/`8851bu`, `rtw89_8852b`/`8852bu`/`8852b_common` all present (module presence only; no firmware cross-check done here) | In-kernel `rtw89` | Build-verified only |
| Realtek Wi-Fi 6E — RTL8852CU / RTL8832CU | Not supported in either stock era | Out-of-tree `rtl8852cu-morrownr` — the *only* driver that exists for this chip on USB anywhere, in or out of tree: mainline's `rtw89` has the chip's radio HAL but only a PCIe bus file, and this board has no PCIe | **Not yet built, let alone tested** — added by reading the driver's source, not compiled ([`docs/wifi-parity.md` §8](docs/wifi-parity.md)) |
| AICSemi Wi-Fi 6 — AIC8800 / 8800DC / 8800D80 / 8800D80N / 8800D80X2 / 8800DLN (the cheap AX sticks: **Tenda U2, U11, U11 Pro**, TP-Link/Mercury, TX1U Nano) | **Not supported in either stock era.** Stock's 6.18 fork *added the driver source* on 2026-09-11 (`MiSTer-v6.18` `c129b0fac3`, 82 k lines vendored at `drivers/net/wireless/aic8800`), but as of Release 20260907 it has shipped **neither the module nor the firmware blobs** the driver loads — and `Linux_Image_creator_MiSTer`'s newest commit pre-dates the driver commit. On stock today the chip binds nothing | Out-of-tree `package/aic8800`, from [`shenmintao/aic8800d80`](https://github.com/shenmintao/aic8800d80), builds `aic_load_fw`, `aic8800_fdrv` and `aic_zlp_quirk`, installs all six firmware directories (~6.6 MiB) under `/lib/firmware/<variant>/`, and includes upstream udev rules plus the Pandora USB-mode-switch config. Package tracks upstream `main` only: use only with `chip_mcu_id=0` or unknown hardware; `chip_mcu_id=1` requires the un-packaged `legacy-mcu1` branch and matching firmware | Source pin, archive hash and firmware-path check verified; **package build and hardware are unverified** after the source switch. DE10 only; not enabled for DE25, whose aarch64 build is untried |
| Broadcom / Cypress — BCM43xx, CYW43xx USB adapters | **Not supported at all, in either stock era** — no `brcmfmac`/`brcmutil` in `evidence/stock-20260907-modules.txt` either | In-kernel `brcmfmac` | Build-verified only |

| MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 / Wi-Fi 7 — MT7921U (802.11ax), MT7925U (802.11be, 6 GHz-capable) | **5.15:** not supported. **6.18 (20260907): now built *and* fed** — `mt7921u`/`mt7921-common` + `mt7925u`/`mt7925-common`/`mt792x-lib`/`mt792x-usb` are all present, **and** stock's firmware set gained the Wi-Fi-side blobs each needs (`mediatek/WIFI_MT7961_patch_mcu_1_2_hdr.bin`+`WIFI_RAM_CODE_MT7961_1.bin` for the MT7921 family, `mediatek/mt7925/WIFI_MT7925_PATCH_MCU_1_1_hdr.bin`+`WIFI_RAM_CODE_MT7925_1_1.bin` for MT7925) — module and firmware presence only, not hardware-tested against stock | In-kernel `mt76` (`mt7921u` / `mt7925u`) | Build-verified only |

Both are recorded in [`bluetooth-parity` §9's "Deliberately NOT shipped"](docs/bluetooth-parity.md) | General Bluetooth pairing is **hardware-verified**; these specific chipset gaps were closed by reading each driver's firmware-request code, not by plugging one in |

**One deliberate exclusion, not an oversight.** `ATH10K_USB` (Qualcomm/Atheros
QCA9377 over USB — e.g. the Linksys WUSB6100M) is the one modern 802.11ac USB
chip this image does not build a driver for. Upstream's own kernel Kconfig
calls it out: *"Currently work in progress and will not fully work."* Binding
a dongle to a driver that then fails is worse than binding it to nothing, so
it stays off. **Stock's Release 20260907 disagrees**: `evidence/stock-20260907-modules.txt`
carries `ath10k_core`/`ath10k_usb`, and `evidence/stock-20260907-firmware.txt` carries the
matching `ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/{board-2.bin,firmware-6.bin}` board data — so stock now
ships exactly the driver upstream itself warns against, unchanged reasoning, our own
choice to omit it. Every other driver family the audit found — 30 of 36 — is
built. Of the six that are not, this is one; four are 2000s-era 802.11b/g parts
(`AR5523` ~2004, `AT76C50X_USB` ~2001, `P54_USB` ~2004, `ZD1211RW` ~2005) with
no realistic install base today; and the sixth, `PLFXLC`, is pureLiFi optical
hardware that happens to live under `drivers/net/wireless/` without being Wi-Fi
at all ([`docs/wifi-parity.md` §7](docs/wifi-parity.md)).

**Why "build-verified" and "hardware-verified" are called out separately, and
not glossed over**: this table represents a large, single-branch expansion —
several new chip vendors, a new Wi-Fi generation, and a Bluetooth firmware
pass — landed and documented before a second device could be sourced and
tested against most of it. The driver source and firmware request paths were
read line-by-line for every entry above (file:line citations in
[`docs/wifi-parity.md`](docs/wifi-parity.md) and
[`docs/bluetooth-parity.md`](docs/bluetooth-parity.md)), and `scripts/ci-tests.sh`
asserts that **the newly-added** modules and firmware land in the built image:
the seven `rtw88` USB modules, `brcmfmac`+`brcmutil`, `rtl8192du`/`ath6kl_usb`/
`rsi_usb`, the one permitted out-of-tree `8852cu.ko`, and a fixed blob list
(MT7663's four files, `ath3k-1.fw`, the four `brcmfmac*.bin`, `rtl8192dufw.bin`,
two `rsi/*.rps`, the three MediaTek BT ram-codes, the QCA USB pair, both
`.hcd`s, `rtl8761b`/`rtl8761bu`). It does **not** yet assert `rtw89_8851bu`/
`rtw89_8852bu`, `mt7663u`/`mt7921u`/`mt7925u`, `ath9k_htc` or `carl9170`, nor
the `rtw89/*.bin`, `htc_9271.fw`/`htc_7010.fw`, `carl9170-1.fw` and `ar3k/*.dfu`
blobs those need — all of which do ship, but unguarded. Concretely: the Realtek
Wi-Fi 6 row has **no** CI presence check at all; the MediaTek Wi-Fi 5 row has its
firmware checked but not its module; the MediaTek Wi-Fi 6/7 row has neither; and
the Atheros row is covered only for `ath6kl_usb`, not for `ath9k_htc`/`carl9170`.
And even where CI does check, a file landing in the image is not the same thing as
a dongle actually associating on this board.
The [hardware validation ledger](#hardware-validation-ledger) is the single
current source of what has been touched with real hardware; treat anything
not listed there as unverified in practice, exactly as that section says.

### 5. Build, release, and supply-chain engineering

This is the half of the project that has no stock counterpart at all, because stock
publishes no build recipe.

- **No vendored Buildroot, ever.** The `Makefile` downloads the pinned release, verifies
  its SHA-256 against **upstream's GPG-signed release manifest**, unpacks it under
  `work/`, and forwards every target into it. A hash mismatch refuses to unpack and tells
  you — at length — why pasting the new hash in is the wrong fix.
- **Byte-identical reproducible builds.** Two independent builds of the same commit
  produce identical `linux.img` and `zImage_dtb`, and a dedicated CI workflow exists to
  prove it. This is what makes the four layered build caches trustworthy as *inputs only*.
  ([`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md))
- **Full SBOM.** Every release ships `legal-info.tar.gz`: `manifest.csv` (package,
  version, license, upstream URL), license texts, and the upstream source tarball of
  every package conveyed — the GPL accompanying-source obligation, discharged properly.
  The same manifest is submitted to GitHub's dependency graph on release, so the package
  list is browsable at
  [Insights → Dependency graph](https://github.com/mcfbytes/Buildroot_MiSTer/network/dependencies)
  without downloading anything ([`docs/ci.md#dependency-graph-submission`](docs/ci.md#dependency-graph-submission)).
- **Provenance attestation** on the release images.
- **No binaries in git. Ever.** Firmware, payloads, and stock blobs are fetched at build
  time, pinned by commit or release **and** hash.
- **Renovate** ([`renovate.json`](renovate.json), [`docs/renovate.md`](docs/renovate.md))
  with a companion hash-sync workflow, because several pins need a *companion* hash that
  a naive version bump would leave stale. Kernel `-rc` bumps **fail closed** on a missing
  hash by design, requiring a human pin.

### 6. Things that are deliberately identical to stock

Parity is a feature, and most of the work is invisible for exactly that reason. This image
reproduces stock's behaviour — not merely its file list — for: the `MiSTer` binary's ABI
and every SONAME it links, the boot chain and U-Boot contract, `/media/fat` mount flags
(`sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime` — mounting async would be a real power-off corruption
regression), the read-only root with the login-time `remount,rw`, the Bluetooth key store,
the firmware set, the init-script set, `busybox` applet coverage, the RTC, MIDI/MT-32,
Samba, SSH/FTP, `/MiSTer.version` semantics, and the Downloader's update contract.

Each of those has its own audited parity document — see the
[documentation map](#documentation-map). The `uboot.img` in the default release channel is
shipped **byte-identical to stock's**, fetched by hash.

---

## What is *not* better — the honest list

- **One known regression.** The Logitech **G923 *PlayStation* variant** loses force
  feedback and range control; steering, pedals and buttons still work as a plain joystick.
  The G923 **Xbox** variant and all G29/G27/G25 wheels are fully supported with force
  feedback intact. ([`docs/patch-provenance.md` §9.3](docs/patch-provenance.md))
- **Not all hardware is validated.** Samba and MIDI are build- and CI-verified only. One
  board, one set of peripherals. The same is true of most of the [Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chipset
  table](#wi-fi-and-bluetooth-hardware-support) — one chip family (Realtek `rtw88`) has
  actually associated on hardware; the rest, including the whole Broadcom, MediaTek, and
  Wi-Fi 6/6E additions, compile but have not had a dongle plugged into this board — and
  CI's presence checks do not even cover all of them (`rtw89_885*bu`, `mt7663u`,
  `mt7921u`/`mt7925u`, `ath9k_htc`, `carl9170` and their firmware are unasserted; see the
  paragraph under that table). The matrix in
  [`docs/testlogs/p3-matrix.md`](docs/testlogs/p3-matrix.md) is the truth; this README is
  a summary of it.
- **This forward-port has already shipped one real bug, on hardware.** Early builds
  **auto-overclocked the board to 1.2 GHz on boot** and produced hard hangs. The carried
  socfpga overclock patch was written against 5.15, where `CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ` kept the
  governor off the boost rows by default; on 6.18 the default `policy->max` resolves
  differently, so the overclock became default-**on**. It applied cleanly, compiled clean,
  and behaved differently. Fixed in PR #24 — proper `->set_boost`, boost-only 1000/1200 MHz
  rows, 800 MHz default — and the board has been stable since. **The lesson generalises:
  any other 5.15-era patch we carry can have the same class of defect**, and no amount of
  CI catches a silent semantic change to a kernel flag. This is the strongest argument
  for the small-delta posture, and the reason the hardware list stays short.
- **RT is a developer variant.** `PREEMPT_RT` boots and runs on hardware, but **no latency
  measurement has been taken yet** — so there is currently *no evidence* it improves
  anything for a normal user. It exists for testing, not for daily driving.
- **Debug tooling is temporarily in-tree.** `gdb`/`strace`/`perf`/`rt-tests` and
  `CONFIG_COREDUMP` are enabled for two investigations. One of them — a field hard-hang —
  **closed on 2026-07-21**; the RT latency measurement has not been taken, so the block
  stays for now. It costs image size and diverges from stock's config, and is designed to
  revert as one unit. ([`docs/debug-tooling.md`](docs/debug-tooling.md))
- **The sustainability gate is not met.** Nobody has yet signed up, in writing, to track
  `6.18.y` security releases through end-of-life. Until that happens this is a personal
  project, and saying otherwise would be the one claim that undermines all the others.
  ([ADR 0014](docs/decisions/0014-sustainability-deferred-not-waived.md))
- **Version numbers drift, and two parity analyses are currently behind the pins.**
  Every figure here was read off the built tree at the time of writing, but **nothing in
  CI asserts a package version**, so a Renovate or Buildroot-line bump can move a package
  out from under the document that reasoned about it. That has already happened twice.
  The Buildroot 2026.05.1 bump moved **Samba 4.23.8 → 4.24.3** and **ProFTPD 1.3.8d →
  1.3.9a** without re-running the P3.6 / P3.7 audits that gated those packages. The
  2026.05.2 bump then moved **OpenSSH 10.3p1 → 10.5p1**, crossing the skipped 10.4
  release where upstream made a failed seccomp `prctl()` fatal rather than a `debug()` —
  which **broke every SSH connection on the shipped image** and forced a release to be
  pulled. Buildroot classified that bump as `openssh: (no CVE assigned)`. Both parity
  documents now say so at the top, with the specific unchecked question named. The
  **2026.08 line bump** then moved the compiler itself — **gcc 14.4.0 → 15.3.0**, glibc
  2.43 → 2.44, gdb 15.2 → 16.3 — plus **bluez 5.79 → 5.86**, Samba 4.24.5 → 4.24.6 and
  OpenSSL 3.6.3 → 3.6.4. Two of those had consequences a version table cannot show: bluez
  5.86 already contains the CablePairing series this repo had been backporting, so
  `board/mister/de10nano/patches/bluez5_utils/` was deleted outright; and Buildroot
  **retired the 7.0 kernel-headers series**, which silently collapsed the DE25 toolchain
  from glibc to uClibc until the headers pin was moved to 7.1 (see
  [`buildroot-config`](docs/buildroot-config.md) §6.2).
  The defconfig and `Makefile` pins are the ground truth; the prose is a dated reading of it.
  For the kernel this is handled by not writing the number down: narrative prose says
  "6.18 LTS", and `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_VERSION_VALUE` in the defconfig is the only
  place the `.y` lives.

### Two kernels, one image

The DE10-Nano's Cyclone V is a dual-core **Cortex-A9 (ARMv7-A, 32-bit)** — there is no
AArch64 path on this silicon, and `PREEMPT_RT` cannot be a boot-time toggle on ARM32. So
RT must be a separately compiled kernel image. `PREEMPT_RT` for 32-bit ARM merged into
mainline in **Linux 7.1**, which means on 7.2 it is a plain kconfig option with **no
out-of-tree RT patch to carry**.

The design ([ADR 0021](docs/decisions/0021-rt-kernel-first-class-ci.md), as amended by
[ADR 0030](docs/decisions/0030-makefile-toward-vanilla-buildroot.md)): the RT kernel is
`package/linux-rt`, a **second kernel package inside the one build** (the same
`board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` plus `linux-rt.fragment`, the beta patch series, the same
embedded stage-1 initramfs). The package hard-asserts `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y` in the configured
kernel, installs its module tree into the **one shipped `linux.img`** next to the main kernel's,
and emits `zImage_dtb-rt` and `linux-rt.config` into `output/images/`. One `make` produces both
kernels; there is no separate tree, overlay or ordering rule any more.

`zImage_dtb-rt` is a **manual download** from the Release page — it is deliberately not on
the `sdcard.img` installer payload and has no `db.json` entry, so no device is ever pushed
an unvalidated real-time kernel. Because its modules are already in the shipped `linux.img`,
opting in is: download it, drop it in `/media/fat/linux/`, add one `u-boot.txt` line.

### The initramfs that deleted a kernel patch

Stock patches `init/do_mounts.c` so the **kernel itself** parses a `loop=` boot parameter,
mounts `/media/fat`, and loop-mounts `linux/linux.img` as the root filesystem. That is a
patch to the most delicate part of early boot, carried forever, for a job userspace does
better.

This project replaces it with a **two-stage boot**: a tiny BusyBox initramfs, embedded in
the kernel via `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`, does the mount dance in a shell script — with
`rootwait` retries, vfat-then-exfat probing, and a rescue shell on failure. One patch
deleted, one whole class of boot failure made debuggable.

The details matter more than they look: `-o sync,dirsync` is not a tuning choice (async
would be a real power-off-corruption regression), the loop **device** must stay writable
even though the rootfs is mounted read-only (or `/etc/profile`'s login-time
`remount,rw` breaks), and `mount -o move` is required because BusyBox `mount` has no long
options. All of it is annotated in [`PLAN.md` §5](PLAN.md) and
[`docs/loop-boot-6.18.md`](docs/loop-boot-6.18.md).

**Forward-looking: the stock patch is 32-bit-ARM-only by construction.** Stock's
`loop_setup()` issues the loop attach as a direct call into the syscall entry points —
`sys_ioctl(device_fd, LOOP_SET_FD, file_fd)` then `sys_close()` — from inside
`init/do_mounts.c`. That compiles on the DE10-Nano's Cortex-A9 only because 32-bit ARM
still defines `sys_ioctl()` as an ordinary C function. Every 64-bit ARM kernel since 4.19
selects `ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_WRAPPER`, which turns each syscall into
`__arm64_sys_ioctl(const struct pt_regs *)` and drops the C-callable `sys_*` prototypes
altogether (`include/linux/syscalls.h` declares them only under
`#ifndef CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_WRAPPER`). On aarch64 the stock patch does not merely
misbehave; it has no symbol to call and cannot build. The kernel's sanctioned
replacements for init-time work — the `init_mount()`, `init_mkdir()`, `init_chdir()`
family in `fs/init.c` — deliberately include no `init_ioctl()`, because an ioctl is
driver-defined and there is nothing generic to wrap, and the internal `vfs_ioctl()` /
`blkdev_ioctl()` paths are private to `fs/` and `block/`. So the only way to keep `loop=`
in-kernel on a 64-bit ARM SoC is the rewrite this project already had to do for 6.18:
export a purpose-built attach helper from the loop driver itself and call it with
`filp_open()`ed files instead of descriptors (`linux-patches-upstream/0100-…`, carried
for the upstream fork, not shipped in this image). That rewrite contains no syscall and
no architecture-specific line, and it does compile for aarch64: applied to a pristine
6.18.48 tree with an arm64 toolchain, `init/do_mounts.o` and `drivers/block/loop.o`
build clean, referencing only `filp_open()`, `init_mount()` and the two exported loop
helpers. So the *rewritten* patch is portable; it is the *stock* patch that is not, and
the rewrite still has to be re-anchored on every kernel line it is carried to (it
already needs a context refresh for 7.x, where the `load_ramdisk=` block it sits next
to was removed). The initramfs design, by contrast,
contains no architecture-specific line at all: `mount`, `losetup`, and
`switch_root` behave identically on any CPU the kernel runs on. Should this image ever
need to boot something that is not a Cyclone V, the boot path comes along unchanged, and
the kernel carries one patch fewer than it otherwise would.

### The full SD-card image

`make sdcard` produces a complete, `dd`-able `sdcard.img` — a two-partition MBR with the
data partition on `p1` and a type-`0xA2` partition carrying `uboot.img` raw at its start,
per the SPL contract. The image ships **small**, so the compressed asset stays small and
the write is fast; a throwaway installer OS then **reformats the card to exFAT at the
device's real size on first boot** — because Linux cannot grow exFAT in place, and exFAT
is what every mr-fusion'd card in the wild uses. That is not an invention: it is
mr-fusion's own mechanism, adopted rather than replaced, per the standing principle of
reusing a proven reference implementation in anything on the boot path.
([ADR 0020](docs/decisions/0020-sdcard-exfat-reformat-installer.md))

**What that first boot looks like.** The installer draws a progress splash — banner, nine
numbered steps, a bar and an elapsed clock — on the **serial console**, and blinks the
DE10-Nano's on-board `HPS_LED` at about 0.5 Hz through the long steps. Solid on is the only
state that means trouble (stopped — failed, or the card was already installed); a dark LED
is just a gap between phases, or the reboot. Note `HPS_LED` is on the board itself, so a
fully-enclosed case will not show it.

The card also carries `menu.rbf` at the FAT **root**, which is what U-Boot loads into the
FPGA before Linux starts — without it the fabric is never configured and HDMI reads "no
signal" for the whole install ([ADR 0020 §7](docs/decisions/0020-sdcard-exfat-reformat-installer.md)).
There is still deliberately **no splash picture** on that output: `/dev/fb0` is only scanned
out once Main_MiSTer programs the frame reader, and Main_MiSTer does not run in the
installer. Painting a picture there would mean shipping mr-fusion's entire stack — its
U-Boot, a second DTB and a framebuffer bitstream — a trade [ADR 0020 §6](docs/decisions/0020-sdcard-exfat-reformat-installer.md)
explains and declines.

Install time does **not** scale with card capacity — a 1 TiB card formats as fast as an
8 GiB one (`mkfs.exfat` writes 88 KiB–1.15 MiB of metadata either way, in ~10 ms). The
dominant cost is the fixed 512 MiB `linux.img` expansion, so what matters is the card's
**write speed**, not its size.

It ships as a **separate release asset**, never inside `release_*.7z` and never referenced
by `db.json`, because its blast radius is the bootloader. The payload it installs is
inventoried against real mr-fusion output in
[`docs/verification/sdcard-payload.md`](docs/verification/sdcard-payload.md).

## Building it yourself

This is a plain Buildroot br2-external. The wrapper `Makefile` fetches and hash-verifies the
pinned Buildroot into `work/buildroot` and forwards everything else to it with `BR2_EXTERNAL`
and `O=` set, so the commands are the ones any Buildroot project uses:

```sh
make mister_de10nano_defconfig  # configure the DE10-Nano image into output/
make                            # build it (first run bootstraps a cross-toolchain — hours, not minutes)
make linux-menuconfig           # or: menuconfig, linux-rt-menuconfig, legal-info, <pkg>-rebuild, help ...
make O=output-de25 mister_de25nano_defconfig && make O=output-de25   # the DE25-Nano (or: make de25)
make sdcard                     # after make all: the SD-card installer image
```

`make` produces `output/images/linux.img`, `zImage_dtb`, `zImage_dtb-rt` (the PREEMPT_RT
variant is a package of the same build) and `mister-initramfs.cpio` (the stage-1 initramfs, also
a package, embedded in both kernels).

**The one thing that is not plain Buildroot:** package selection. `configs/mister_de10nano_defconfig`
does not list two hundred packages; it enables three Kconfig **profiles** —
`BR2_PACKAGE_MISTER_USERSPACE`, `_FIRMWARE`, `_DRIVERS` — whose `select` lists live in
`package/mister-*/Config.in`, grouped and commented the way [`docs/buildroot-config.md`](docs/buildroot-config.md)
§5 documents them. That is what lets the DE25-Nano share the userspace by enabling the same
symbols. "Why is package X in my image?" → `package/mister-userspace/Config.in`.

Things that will bite you otherwise:

- **Do not pass `-j`.** Buildroot's top level is not parallel-safe; it parallelises each
  package internally, defaulting to your CPU count. CI runs a bare `make`.
- **The config is generated once and then left alone.** `make` never regenerates
  `output/.config` (so `menuconfig` edits survive), and `make clean` keeps it. After a `git
  pull` that moves the Buildroot pin (`BUILDROOT_VERSION` in the Makefile), or after a
  `make clean`, run `make mister_de10nano_defconfig` again before building; a config written on
  the previous pin stops Buildroot at an interactive Kconfig prompt. A pin move is best followed
  by `make distclean`.
- **Edit the defconfig, then keep it canonical.** `configs/mister_*_defconfig` are Buildroot's
  own `savedefconfig` form; `scripts/check-defconfigs.sh` (CI's lint) asserts each one loads,
  reproduces itself, and that every profile `select` really lands — a `select` of a kconfig
  `choice` member is ignored silently, which is why e.g. `BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB_NG` stays in the
  defconfig rather than in a profile.

### Useful targets

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make` / `make all` | The shipped image: `linux.img`, `zImage_dtb`, `zImage_dtb-rt`, `mister-initramfs.cpio` |
| `make mister_<board>_defconfig` | Load a board configuration (Buildroot's own `<name>_defconfig`) |
| `make linux-rt` | Rebuild only the `PREEMPT_RT` kernel package |
| `make mister-initramfs` | Rebuild only the stage-1 cpio (then `make linux-rebuild all` to re-embed it) |
| `make sdcard` | Full `sdcard.img(.xz)` — run **after** `make all` |
| `make menuconfig` / `linux-menuconfig` / `linux-rt-menuconfig` | Interactive Buildroot / kernel config |
| `make savedefconfig` | Write the config back to `configs/mister_<board>_defconfig` (**always** do this after editing) |
| `make buildroot-verify` / `buildroot-showsig` | Verify the pinned Buildroot tarball / print upstream's GPG-signed manifest — the *only* valid hash source |
| `make legal-info` | Generate the SBOM (covers both kernels and the stage-1 packages) |
| `make clean` / `distclean` | Buildroot's own meanings, per `O=`; `dl/` is kept (a shared cache) |

### Host requirements

Standard build tools (`gcc`, `make`, `bc`, `flex`, `bison`, `cpio`, `rsync`, `unzip`,
`wget`/`curl`, `python3`), plus `dtc`, `qemu-user`/`qemu-system-arm`, and `shellcheck` for
the test and inventory scripts.

**One sharp edge.** Buildroot refuses to build if `/usr/bin/install` is **uutils coreutils
0.8.0** — it detects that exact version and rejects it (upstream bug
[uutils/coreutils#12166](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/12166)).
Debian/Ubuntu's `coreutils-from-uutils` package installs precisely that as the default
`install`. You do **not** need to fix this yourself and you should not need `sudo`: the
Makefile detects it and transparently shims a GNU `install` into `PATH` for Buildroot only
(`work/.hostshim/`), touching nothing outside this repo. It is inert on a host whose
`install` is already GNU, and fails fast with a clear message if no GNU `install` exists
at all.

## Verification & CI

Nothing here is asserted by hand. The parity claims above are backed by scripts that run
on every push and pull request.

### The test suite

[`scripts/ci-tests.sh`](scripts/ci-tests.sh) is one command that runs the whole
non-hardware suite and prints a self-contained digest last (`| tail -n 30` tells you what
broke and why, without grepping):

- the image-contract checks — `check-zimage-dtb.sh`, `check-linux-img.sh`,
  `check-size-budget.sh`
- the structural initramfs checks, plus a **full QEMU boot test of the initramfs `/init`**
  (eight cases, across the failure paths — and the same eight again on
  `qemu-system-aarch64` for the aarch64 build of the same `/init`, when it has been built)
- an ABI smoke test running the **stock `MiSTer` binary** under `qemu-user` against the
  built rootfs: dynamic linking must resolve clean, and it must die at FPGA access and not
  one instruction earlier
- per-service parity assertions harvested from each Phase 3 parity document, checked
  against the shipped `rootfs.tar` — not against `output/target/`
- a sandboxed functional test of the timezone autodetect dhcpcd hook
  ([`scripts/test-timezone.sh`](scripts/test-timezone.sh)) — it turns a string off the
  network into a filesystem path, so every class of hostile answer is asserted rejected,
  run three times: under the host shell, under the target's own `bash --posix` via `qemu-arm`
  (what `/bin/sh` is on the box, as on stock), and under the target's BusyBox `ash`

Alongside it, [`scripts/check-abi.sh`](scripts/check-abi.sh) runs the full
SONAME/loader checklist from [`docs/abi-contract.md`](docs/abi-contract.md). The overlap on
the two highest-value gates is deliberate.

### The pipeline

| Workflow | Trigger | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `build.yml` | push to `master`, every PR | Kernel-variant matrix, then the image, then the parity + ABI suite — plus the patch-header lint and the kernel-defconfig sync check |
| `release.yml` | `v*` tags | Rebuilds from scratch (never adopts a CI run), assembles `release_YYYYMMDD.7z`, drafts the GitHub Release |
| `publish-db.yml` | release *published* | Regenerates `db.json`, schema-checks it, deploys it to GitHub Pages |
| `reproducibility.yml` | manual dispatch | Proves two independent builds are byte-identical. Manual on purpose: it is a double build, and its input caches are only warm after `build.yml` has run |
| `renovate-hash-sync.yml` | Renovate PRs | Refreshes companion hashes a version bump leaves stale; validates the one pin that has none (the `_Console` cores snapshot) |
| `renovate-validate.yml` | config changes | An invalid Renovate config makes Renovate skip the repo **silently** — this is the only signal you would ever get |
| `fork-sync.yml` | weekly | Diffs the last-reconciled fork commits against upstream's live HEADs and keeps one issue updated with the backport queue |
| `lint.yml` | push, PR | `actionlint` over the workflows, `shellcheck` over `scripts/**` and the composite actions' `run:` bodies |
| `cache-prune.yml` | PR closed, daily | Deletes the ~5 GB Actions cache scope a closed PR leaves behind — dead PRs were evicting master's warm `dl/` under GitHub's 10 GB LRU ceiling |

The full rationale, incident history, and measured numbers live in
[`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md) — the workflows keep the imperative and the run ID, that
document keeps the narrative and the "we tried X and it failed."

## Releases & distribution

Release artifacts are published as **GitHub Release assets**; no binaries live in git.
The main set is seven files (the Downloader-contract set: the `release_YYYYMMDD.7z`,
`linux.img`, `zImage_dtb`, both `.config`s, `legal-info.tar.gz`, `SHA256SUMS`), plus three
`-rt` files per kernel variant, plus the separately contracted `sdcard.img.xz`.

Distribution is **opt-in and requires zero cooperation from anyone**: a community
`db.json`, served from GitHub Pages, that the standard on-device Downloader reads.

**Coexistence with the official channel is the hard part, and it is solved**
([ADR 0025](docs/decisions/0025-update-linux-kill-switch-and-private-updater.md)). The
Downloader applies at most **one** Linux image per run, and `distribution_mister` always
offers one too. When several databases offer one, it sorts the candidates by their
**position in `downloader.ini`** and takes the first — and since drop-in databases are
merged *after* the base ini's own sections, and Update All pins `[distribution_mister]` to
the top on every rewrite, the official image wins **whenever that database is actually processed** — which is most real runs, since its content changes whenever any core does. (A run where nothing changed skips the database entirely and applies no Linux image at all: `can_skip_db` returns true when `file_checking` is `FASTEST`, the steady-state default, and a skipped database's `linux` entry is never looked at.) Not a race that might go
our way: a loss whenever it is contested, silently reverting the user on a routine core
update.

So this project doesn't compete for that slot; it closes it:

- `[MiSTer] update_linux = false` in `downloader.ini` stops **every** normal run from
  applying **any** Linux image. Cores, ROMs, MRAs and Jotego keep updating untouched.
- `Scripts/update_linux_modernization.sh` runs the Downloader against its **own private
  ini** naming one database, so there is nothing to sort and nothing to lose.
- That is the entire mechanism. No boot script, no daemon, no state files: the running
  system already tells you what you need (`/MiSTer.version` says which image, and
  `update_linux` says whether it is protected), and nothing re-applies the setting behind
  you — the updater is the only thing that writes it, and only when you run it. Which is
  also why reverting is one edit, with nothing to opt out of.

Verified on hardware: a full `update_all.sh` run installed 379 cores, rebooted, and came
back with `linux.img` and `zImage_dtb` **byte-identical**, the Downloader's own config
dump recording `update_linux: false` and `UPDATE_LINUX: undefined` — Update All never
overrides it. The shipped `downloader.ini` also reproduces Update All's default database
set plus **Jotego**, so a fresh `sdcard.img` flash
needs no user action at all. Rolling back is one command,
`update_linux_modernization.sh --restore-stock` — see
[`docs/user/rollback.md`](docs/user/rollback.md).

One subtlety worth calling out because getting it wrong bricks the update loop: stock's
Downloader compares versions with a **strict string inequality**, not an ordering, and
`/MiSTer.version` is derived from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` — which reproducible builds pin to a
constant. Two releases from the same Buildroot pin would therefore have carried an
*identical* version string, and a user would never be offered the newer one. Both the
image stamp and the published version now derive from the tagged release date instead.

## Goals

| # | Goal |
|---|------|
| G1 | A `linux.img` + `zImage_dtb` that boots the **unmodified, stock** `MiSTer` binary |
| G2 | Modern kernel on a supported LTS with a real security-update path |
| G3 | Modern package set (Buildroot 2026.08) with a real security-update path |
| G4 | **No separate kernel repo.** All kernel patches live as `.patch` files in the Buildroot external tree, applied to a pristine kernel.org tarball |
| G5 | Fully reproducible: pinned Buildroot, pinned kernel + hash, checked-in `.config`, published SBOM |
| G6 | Release artifacts published as **GitHub Release assets**. No binaries in git. Ever. |
| G7 | Opt-in distribution via a community `db.json` — zero cooperation required |

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome **once the Phase 4 publication gate is passed**. Until then this
is a personal-use project.

When it opens, all contributions must follow the discipline in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): patch provenance tracking, developer sign-off (DCO),
and the standing rules from `TASKS.md` — reproducibility, no vendored binaries,
hash-pinned upstream sources, and no behaviour changes smuggled into build fixes.

See [`PLAN.md` §13](PLAN.md) for the sustainability requirements and the risk discussion
behind the gate.
