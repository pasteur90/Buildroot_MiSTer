Every change in `MiSTer-devel/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` (branch `MiSTer-v5.15`,
HEAD `f0fb626acadd07f0718934826b143b6e4c9ce81c`, 2026-07-08) classified per `PLAN.md` §4.1,
with upstream status verified against **real Linux 6.18.38 source** (not from memory), and a
disposition for each.

This is the map that `P1.4`–`P1.9` consume. Every row is independently verifiable from the
cited commit SHA, `file:line`, or upstream commit.

**Status:** complete. All 109 fork commits accounted for; content diff reconciles exactly.

## 1. Method — how the baseline was established

### 1.1 The problem with the task as originally written

`TASKS.md` P0.4 says "enumerate every commit not in upstream `v5.15.1`", implying
`git log v5.15.1..HEAD`. **That command cannot work.** The fork is *not* a git-ancestry fork
of `torvalds/linux`:

* `git -C work/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer tag -l` → **zero tags**. There is no `v5.15.1` ref.
* The root commit `e12ed6c19` ("v5.13.12", no parents) is a **single squashed import** of the
  entire 5.13.12 source tree (72,216 files).
* "Version bump" commits (`137491a75` v5.14, `b6f2ca1c4` v5.14.5, `aba1ef4c1` v5.15.1) replace
  the tree wholesale. There is no shared commit graph with mainline, so no `merge-base` exists.

Commit ancestry is therefore only good for **provenance** (who/when/why). It cannot be trusted
for **completeness**. Completeness requires a *content* diff against a genuine upstream tree.

### 1.2 Baseline: a pristine, hash-verified v5.15.1

```sh
curl -o work/linux-5.15.1.tar.xz https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.1.tar.xz
curl -o work/sha256sums-5.15.1.asc https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/sha256sums.asc
sha256sum work/linux-5.15.1.tar.xz
# 32fdcd33c8ac571b9a7a297f33860f6171327961f2a2ea6bd54bf82275b614c8
# -- matches kernel.org's signed sha256sums.asc entry for linux-5.15.1.tar.xz  ✓
tar xf work/linux-5.15.1.tar.xz -C work/
```

Both trees were then reduced to `path → (mode, git blob SHA)` listings and compared. Blob SHA
equality is exact content equality:

```sh
# pristine side
cd work/linux-5.15.1 && git init -q . && git add -Af . && git ls-files -s   # 73,614 files
# fork side
git -C work/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer ls-tree -r aba1ef4c1    # 73,603 files
git -C work/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer ls-tree -r HEAD         # 77,061 files
```

### 1.3 Load-bearing finding: `aba1ef4c1` lands a PRISTINE v5.15.1 tree

Comparing `aba1ef4c1`'s tree against pristine v5.15.1:

| Result | Count |
|---|---|
| Files with **differing content or mode** | **0** |
| Files **added** by MiSTer at/before the bump | **0** |
| Files **missing** from the fork | 11 |

**Zero content differences and zero added files.** The version-bump commit lands an unmodified
upstream tree. **Therefore the 109 commits after `aba1ef4c1` are the complete MiSTer delta** —
nothing is hidden inside the squashed import.

The 11 missing files are an artefact of MiSTer's original import, not a MiSTer change:

```
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/.yamllint      tools/testing/selftests/arm64/tags/.gitignore
fs/ext4/.kunitconfig                             tools/testing/selftests/arm64/tags/Makefile
fs/fat/.kunitconfig                              tools/testing/selftests/arm64/tags/run_tags_test.sh
lib/kunit/.kunitconfig                           tools/testing/selftests/arm64/tags/tags_test.c
tools/perf/include/perf/perf_dlfilter.h          tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_progs.c
                                                 tools/testing/selftests/tc-testing/plugins/__init__.py
```

Evidence they are import noise, not deletions: they are **absent from the root commit
`e12ed6c19`** and **never touched by any commit** (`git log --all -- <path>` → empty). None is
`.gitignore`d (`git check-ignore` → no match on any of them). All 11 are KUnit configs, lint
configs, userspace `perf`, or selftests — **none is compiled into a kernel image**. Zero impact.

### 1.4 The authoritative delta: HEAD tree vs pristine v5.15.1

| | Count |
|---|---|
| **Added** | 3,485 files (3,428 = vendored Realtek WiFi trees, class E) |
| **Removed** | 38 files (11 import artefacts + 15 `scripts/gdb/linux/*.py` + 12 mainline `fs/exfat/*`) |
| **Modified** | 48 files |

Excluding the vendored WiFi trees, the entire MiSTer delta is **57 added + 38 removed +
48 modified = 143 files.** That is the real size of the problem.

### 1.5 Reconciliation (content diff ⟷ commit list) — exact

Cross-checked in both directions:

* **In the content diff but touched by no commit:** exactly the 11 import artefacts (§1.3). ✓
* **Touched by a commit but not in the final diff:** 149 files — 148 under
  `drivers/net/wireless/realtek/` (added by `33ff5146a`, later replaced by the morrownr
  backport `3740d5b88`) and `fs/exfat/exfat_config.h` (added by `df35bdb27`, removed by
  `7f7148c1f`). All transient-by-construction. ✓

No unexplained residue in either direction.

### 1.6 Upstream verification

```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch linux-6.18.y \
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git work/linux-stable
git -C work/linux-stable describe --tags   # v6.18.38
```

Every "drop — upstream" claim below was checked by grepping the **actual 6.18.38 source** for
the specific VID/PID, symbol, or code path — and, where merged, the introducing commit was
recovered with `git log -S<string> --reverse -- <path>`. Device IDs were checked **one by one**:
a driver existing upstream does not mean MiSTer's IDs are in it. (This caught the NSO Famicom
and Elite 2 paddle gaps — see §3.)

> **Methodology note / trap for reviewers.** An early sweep here used a buggy shell helper that
> passed the grep pattern twice, so `grep` exited 2 on a nonexistent file and every probe
> reported "ABSENT". It produced confident false negatives for `BTN_GRIPL`, `ABS_PROFILE`, the
> 8BitDo Ultimate, and the Xbox Elite 2 — all of which *are* upstream. Every "ABSENT" below was
> re-derived with a corrected helper that prints the matching line. If you re-run this triage,
> print your matches; do not trust a bare boolean.

### 1.7 Correction to the plan's commit count

`PLAN.md` §4.1 and §14 say the fork carries **"~60 commits"**. The real number is **109**
commits after the last version bump (113 total including the four squashed imports). The
delta is larger than the plan assumes, though the *carried* set is smaller than 109 — see the
histogram. **Recommendation for P0.9: change "~60" to "109" in PLAN.md §4.1, §12 and §14.**

### 1.8 Class histogram (all 109 commits)

| Class | Commits | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **A** — MiSTer core (fb / audio / cpufreq) | 4 | carry → `0001`–`0003` |
| **A** — DTS + `socfpga.dtsi` | 13 | carry → `0004` |
| **A** — `MiSTer_defconfig` | 11 | **not a patch** — input to P1.3 |
| **B** — `loop=` root patch | 1 | **delete** — replaced by initramfs (§5) |
| **C** — HID, now upstream | 22 | **drop** (each cites a mainline commit) |
| **D** — HID/input, still out-of-tree | 30 | carry → `0010`+ |
| **D** — xone | 7 | **re-source** as `package/xone` (medusalix) |
| **E** — Realtek USB WiFi | 9 | **re-source** as `package/rtl*` (morrownr) |
| **F** — misc quirks | 5 | 1 drop, 1 no-op, 3 carry |
| **G** — exfat replacement *(new class — not in PLAN §4.1)* | 6 | ADR 0010: drop driver; ADR 0019: restore symlinks as patch `0031` (option (c)) |
| noise | 1 | dismissed |
| **Total** | **109** | |

---

## 2. New findings that are NOT in PLAN.md

Four things this triage found that the plan does not model. Two are high-severity.

### N1 — The fork REPLACES mainline exfat with the out-of-tree Samsung driver, which supports **symlinks** and **FAT12/16/32** (HIGH)

`8b6b8c2f5` "Remove original exFAT driver" deletes all 12 mainline `fs/exfat/*.c|h` files;
`df35bdb27` "Add exFAT with symlinks support" drops in the old Samsung/`exfat-nofuse` driver
(`exfat_core.c`, `exfat_super.c`, `exfat_oal.c`, …). Proof it is the out-of-tree driver and not
mainline's: the **stock kernel config** carries its Kconfig symbols, which mainline has never
had —

```
CONFIG_EXFAT_DISCARD=y            CONFIG_EXFAT_DELAYED_SYNC=y
CONFIG_EXFAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE=437 CONFIG_EXFAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET="utf8"
```
(`docs/stock-inventory/20250402/stock-linux.config`; mainline 5.15/6.18 `fs/exfat/Kconfig` has only
`EXFAT_FS` and `EXFAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET`.)

Three consequences, all user-visible:

1. **Symlinks on `/media/fat` work today and will not on mainline exfat/vfat.**
   `fs/exfat/exfat_super.c:676` `exfat_symlink()`, `:1088` `.symlink`, `:1111`
   `exfat_symlink_inode_operations`. Mainline exfat has **no symlink support at all**
   (`grep symlink linux-6.18.38/fs/exfat/*.c` → empty); nor does vfat.
   Symlinks are stored in the **FAT `ATTR_SYSTEM` (0x04) attribute bit** — deliberately, so
   Windows preserves them on copy (commit `99a2c80d0`: *"use ATTR_SYSTEM as symlink flag to
   preserve links while copying on Windows or other OS"*, `fs/exfat/exfat_api.h:65`). Because
   it is a generic FAT directory-entry attribute, **symlinks work on FAT32 and exFAT alike**.
   **Main_MiSTer consumes them:** `Main_MiSTer/file_io.cpp:1592` —
   `// Handle (possible) symbolic link type in the directory entry` — `stat()`s `DT_LNK`
   entries and resolves them to `DT_REG`/`DT_DIR`. Added Jan 2019 by Sorgelig
   (`Main_MiSTer` commit `325f6b6` "Improved handling of symbolic links"). Community setups
   that symlink `games/` folders onto USB/network storage depend on this.

2. **The `exfat` driver also mounts FAT12/16/32** (`fs/exfat/exfat_core.c:30` —
   *"PROJECT : exFAT & FAT12/16/32 File System"*). This is why the class-B kernel patch can
   hardcode `init_mount(..., "exfat", ...)` for a FAT32 SD card (§4).

3. **Filename encoding differs.** Stock mounts *both* FAT32 and exFAT through this driver with
   `iocharset=utf8` (`EXFAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET`). Mainline vfat defaults to
   `CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET="iso8859-1"` (also stock's value — but stock's vfat driver is
   never used for `/media/fat`). If P1.10 mounts FAT32 with mainline `vfat` and default
   options, **non-ASCII filenames will be decoded differently** (mojibake in the file browser,
   broken paths). P1.10 must mount vfat with `-o iocharset=utf8` (and/or set
   `CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_UTF8=y`).

**Disposition: decision required at P0.9.** Options:
* **(a) Accept the regression** — use mainline exfat + vfat, lose symlinks on `/media/fat`,
  fix encoding with mount options. Cheap. Silently breaks an existing user-visible feature.
* **(b) Carry the out-of-tree driver** — forward-port a 2012-era Samsung driver
  (`user_namespace`→`mnt_idmap`, folio-based `address_space_operations`, `iov_iter` churn) to
  6.18. Large, ongoing maintenance burden; exactly the kind of hot-file patch §5 exists to
  eliminate.
* **(c) Add symlink support to mainline exfat** as a small carried patch, using the same
  `ATTR_SYSTEM` encoding, so on-disk links stay compatible. Smallest patch that preserves the
  ABI. Plausibly upstreamable.

**Resolved:** ADR 0010 (2026-07-12) chose (a); ADR 0019 (2026-07-14) amended it to (c) after
the arcade organizer's symlink dependency surfaced — see ADR 0019 §1.1 for why the "0
symlinks" evidence was a d_type false negative. Implemented as
`board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches/0031-exfat-samsung-symlinks.patch` (~140 lines,
`page_symlink()`/`page_get_link()` based; "plausibly upstreamable" was optimistic — see the
patch's Upstream field). FAT12/16/32 symlinks remain unrestored (vfat is untouched).

### N2 — PLAN §13 mis-describes the `altspi`/spidev hazard (mechanism, not severity)

§13 says *"There is no `altspi` driver anywhere in MiSTer's kernel — `spidev` is binding it as
a catch-all."* **That is not what happens.** MiSTer explicitly patched spidev's match table:

```c
/* work/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer/drivers/spi/spidev.c:699 — added by commit 246984fce */
    { .compatible = "micron,spi-authenta" },
+   { .compatible = "altspi" },
```

So `altspi` is an out-of-tree **one-line kernel patch**, not a catch-all bind. The *hazard is
still real and still fatal* — 6.18's spidev binds **only** compatibles listed in
`spidev_dt_ids[]` (`linux-6.18.38/drivers/spi/spidev.c:720`), so an unlisted `altspi` node
simply never probes: no `/dev/spidev1.0`, and `brightness.cpp` silently loses I/O-board
brightness control. But the fix framing changes: we already own both sides.
* **Preferred:** change the DTS `compatible` to one 6.18's spidev already accepts (zero kernel
  patches). Note 6.18's entries carry `.data = &spidev_of_check`; an entry without `.data` is
  fine (`spidev_probe()` skips the check when `device_get_match_data()` returns NULL).
* **Fallback:** re-carry the one-liner as `0005-…`.
Because we ship our own DTB, changing the compatible breaks nothing. **P1.8 should prefer the
DTS route.** (Plan text should be corrected at P0.9.)

### N3 — `/media/fat` is mounted `sync,dirsync` by the kernel, and nothing else remounts it (MEDIUM)

The class-B patch mounts the data partition with
`MS_DIRSYNC | MS_SYNCHRONOUS | MS_NOATIME | MS_NODIRATIME` (§4). The stock `/etc/fstab` has
**no `/media/fat` entry at all** (verified: `work/imgroot/etc/fstab`), so those flags are the
only ones it ever has. The §5 `/init` sketch mounts it with default (async) options.
**P1.10 must mount `/media/fat` `-o sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime` for parity**, or accept a
deliberate, documented change — writes to saves/configs would no longer be flushed
immediately, which changes power-off-corruption behaviour on a device users switch off at the
wall. This is a behavioural contract, not a performance tunable.

### N4 — MiSTer's ALSA card is a *patched `snd-dummy`*, and the real audio ABI is `/dev/MrAudio` (MEDIUM)

`TASKS.md` P1.5 says *"Card/device name exposed to userland must match stock (Main_MiSTer opens
it by name)"*. **Main_MiSTer does not open ALSA at all** (no `snd_pcm`/`asound` references in
the source). The actual contract is two-part:

1. `sound/drivers/dummy.c` is **patched** (commit `333d49b95`): `fake_buffer` flipped `1`→`0`
   and a `model_MiSTer` (S16_LE, 48 kHz, 2ch, 32 KiB buffer) force-selected as the default
   model. The card keeps snd-dummy's stock names — `card->driver`/`shortname` = `"Dummy"`,
   `longname` = `"Dummy 1"` (`dummy.c:1095-1097`, unmodified).
2. `sound/drivers/MiSTer-audio-spi.c` creates the char device **`/dev/MrAudio`** and DMAs PCM
   to the FPGA over SPI.

They are glued by **`/etc/asound.conf`** (`work/imgroot/etc/asound.conf`), which is the real
ABI:

```
pcm.!default { type plug; slave.pcm { type rate; slave {
  format S16_LE; rate 48000;
  pcm { type file; file "/dev/MrAudio"; format "raw"; slave.pcm { type hw; card 0 } } } } }
```

So: **ALSA card 0 must exist and accept S16_LE/48000/2ch** (satisfied by the patched
snd-dummy), and **`/dev/MrAudio` must exist and accept raw S16_LE 48 kHz stereo writes.**
`CONFIG_SND_DUMMY=y` and `CONFIG_SND_MISTER_AUDIO=y` are both required (verified in stock
config and in HEAD's `MiSTer_defconfig`). **`0002-…` must therefore contain the `dummy.c` patch
as well as the new driver** — porting only `MiSTer-audio-spi.c` yields a silent system.

### N5 — Two carried patches are dead weight (minor, but free wins)

* `drivers/usb/dwc2/core.c` (from `077c2c317`) is a **no-op**. It removes the
  `if (hsotg->params.oc_disable)` guard — but the same commit also adds
  `disable-over-current` to the `&usb1` DTS node, and dwc2 parses that property
  unconditionally (`5.15.1 drivers/usb/dwc2/params.c:468`; still present in
  `6.18.38 drivers/usb/dwc2/params.c:60`). `oc_disable` is therefore already `true` and the
  guard was always taken. **Drop the C patch; keep the DTS property.** **DROPPED (P1.9,
  confirmed) — TASKS.md P1.9 explicit ruling.** Owned by `0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch`
  (P1.7): that patch must carry only the `disable-over-current` DTS hunk from `077c2c317`,
  not its `drivers/usb/dwc2/core.c` hunk.
* `include/uapi/linux/vt.h` `MAX_NR_CONSOLES 63 → 9` (`b2a04cbfd`) is a UAPI header edit for a
  few KB of memory. **DROPPED (P1.9, confirmed)** — see §3.7 F-3.

### 3.2 Class B — `loop=` root patch (delete from our image; carried for export — §12)

| Commit | Subject | Files | Origin | Upstream | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `3d95de58f` | Support for init loop device | `init/do_mounts.c` (+101/−4), `drivers/block/loop.c` (+7) | Sorgelig | no — and `mount_block_root()`/`init_mount()` were **removed** from `init/do_mounts.c` in the 6.x rewrite | **delete (from our image)** — replaced by initramfs (§5). Full analysis: §4. **Not dropped overall** — carried for the exported `Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` tree only; see §12 |

### 3.3 Class C — HID/BT/storage, now upstream (drop — 22 commits)

Every row verified against 6.18.38 source; upstream commit recovered with `git log -S`.

| Commit(s) | Subject | Upstream in 6.18 — citation | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `c4ec5cb40` | Switch Pro/Joy-Con backport | **`2af16c1f846b`** *HID: nintendo: add nintendo switch controller driver* (2021-09-11, v5.16) | `drivers/hid/hid-nintendo.c` present |
| `9bdab534b` | hid-nintendo: default calibration if empty | **`50503e360eeb`** (2022-09-21) — plausibility check is a proven strict superset of the fork's `max==min` guard (kernel-recon, sonnet-verified) | 6.18 `hid-nintendo.c:1089-1092` |
| ~~`60821059c`~~ | ~~home LED non-fatal~~ **CORRECTED 2026-07-15: only partial upstream** — `8b30fb40f8f2` made the *set*-failure non-fatal; *registration* failure still fails probe in 6.18 | → **carried**, `0035-hid-nintendo-home-led-nonfatal.patch` | Pro-Controller-clone tolerance |
| ~~`45283785a`~~ | ~~combo LED~~ **CORRECTED 2026-07-15: NOT upstream** — `:combo` LED is fork-only; Main_MiSTer's ONLY Joy-Con pairing path reads/writes it (`input.cpp:4704/4715/4822-23`) | → **carried**, `0032-hid-nintendo-joycon-combo-led.patch` | grouping error hid a coupled silent regression |
| `e155f6a2f`, `2799f8b94`, `b00a72159` | NSO NES/SNES, N64, Mega Drive | **`94f18bb19945`** *HID: nintendo: add support for nso controllers* (2023-12-04) | 6.18 `hid-ids.h:1066-1068`: `SNESCON 0x2017`, `GENCON 0x201e`, `N64CON 0x2019`. **Device-ID table is identical to the fork's.** **2026-07-15:** two behavioral divergences found (kernel-recon): NES/Famicom **A/B are swapped** vs stock → restored via `0034-hid-nintendo-nes-famicom-stock-ab-mapping.patch`; `b00a72159`'s BT product-ID forcing (MD pad reports SNES PID) is not upstream. **CORRECTED 2026-07-24 → carried, `0038-hid-nintendo-nso-genesis-bt-pid.patch`.** The earlier "known low-impact limitation … not carried" ruling was wrong on both counts: it is a **stock-parity gap** (stock forces the PID at `MiSTer-v5.15:hid-nintendo.c:1761-1765`; `grep -c 'hdev->product = '` on v6.18.39 = **0**), and the impact is not low — *because* SDL gamecontrollerdb keys off raw VID:PID, the bogus PID makes a Bluetooth Genesis pad match the **NSO SNES** row and come out mismapped. Missed because stock names the device `MDCON`/`JOYCON_CTLR_TYPE_MD` where mainline names the same PID/value `GENCON`/`JOYCON_CTLR_TYPE_GEN`. Found by tree-diffing our export against upstream's own 6.18 port — see `docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-07.md` §8.1. |

| `f84543926` + `b76b4bc6a` | single `:player_id` LED (0-6) | **NOT upstream** (vanilla: five auto-assigned `:white:player-N`); Main_MiSTer co-designed against `:player_id` (`input.cpp:2642-2726`) | → **carried**, `0033-hid-playstation-dualsense-player-id-led.patch` |
| `60e08955f` | mute → BTN_Z + `:mute` LED | **NOT upstream** (6.18 still toggles mic in-kernel; the two SHAs cited above contain zero mute content) | → **carried**, `0037-hid-playstation-dualsense-mute-btn-z.patch` (2026-07-15) — BTN_Z becomes an extra mappable button, matching stock |

| `552f9f197` | hci_conn: prevent call with NULL pointer | **restructured** — the patched function `create_le_conn_complete()` no longer lives in `net/bluetooth/hci_conn.c`; it moved to `net/bluetooth/hci_sync.c:6942` with a different signature (`(hdev, void *data, int err)`), and `hci_connect_le_scan_cleanup()` now takes `(conn, status)` | patch site gone; NULL path structurally absent |
| `b02a4a011` | btusb: support for more CSR clones | **superseded** — 6.18 `btusb.c:2472-2530` carries a far more evolved fake-CSR detector (`bcdDevice` list `0x0100/0x0134/0x1915/0x2520/0x7558/0x8891`, ranged `lmp_subver`/`hci_ver` tests) | ⚠ **6.18 does not explicitly handle `lmp_subver == 0x2512`** (MiSTer's addition), and 0x2512 falls outside 6.18's `<= 0x22bb` range test.

| — | *(folded in)* `drivers/input/joydev.c` Nintendo `ACCEL_DEV` | **`4ff5b10840a8`** *HID: nintendo: add IMU support* (2021-09-11) | 6.18 `joydev.c:760-765` defines the same Nintendo VID/PIDs in the accelerometer blacklist |

### 3.5 Class D/E — xone (re-source, 7 commits)

| Commits | Subject | Origin | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `4ddd8ec3d`, `5a7965488`, `c708f2222`, `e2eb39e6f`, `8270e78f4`, `d776ddb4e`, `d5beb5aa6` | Add/refresh xone (Xbox wireless adapter, GIP) — 19 files, `drivers/hid/xone/**`, `CONFIG_JOYSTICK_XONE=m` | vendored from **`medusalix/xone`** (MIT/GPL); MiSTer-local additions: rumble fix, Elite-2 paddles backport, per-PID firmware, sysfs software pairing | **✅ re-sourced (P3.2)** → `package/xone`, from **`dlundqvist/xone`** (the actively-maintained fork — `medusalix/xone`, the original this was vendored from, is explicitly "in maintenance mode" per its own README). **All 4 of MiSTer's local deltas turned out to be unnecessary as separate patches**: checked directly in the pinned source, not assumed — `driver/gamepad.c` already carries rumble handling and a `PaddleCapability` enum with distinct `PADDLE_ELITE`/`PADDLE_ELITE2_4X`/`PADDLE_ELITE2_510` firmware-version cases (a *more* granular Elite-2 paddle implementation than a simple backport), `transport/dongle.c` already builds per-PID firmware filenames (`sprintf(fwname, "xone_dongle_%04x.bin", fw_product)`), and already exposes a mutex-guarded sysfs `pairing` attribute (`xone_dongle_pairing_handler`) — the actively-maintained fork independently grew equivalent functionality to what MiSTer's maintainer patched onto the older base. Zero compat patches needed for 6.18 either (see `package/xone/xone.mk`). Firmware redistribution: **decided** — `docs/decisions/0003-xone-firmware.md` (Accepted), `package/xow-firmware` + `package/cabextract`. **Not upstream in mainline** (`grep -rl gip_driver drivers/` in 6.18 → nothing) |

### 3.6 Class E — Realtek USB WiFi (re-source, 9 commits)

Vendored wholesale: **3,428 files**. Triaged as whole trees, not line-by-line.

| Commits | Subject | Origin | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|

Local-fix action item **resolved**: `115b1d1ae` superseded (morrownr source never had the mis-bound ID; 7392:B822 is claimed by mainline `rtw8822bu.c:18`); `fc09a292a` EDUP efuse fallback exists in **neither** mainline nor morrownr — **deliberate drop** (user decision 2026-07-15), known limitation for corrupt-EFUSE EP-AC1661 units. |

### 3.7 Class F — misc quirks

| # | Commit | Subject | File | Upstream in 6.18 | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-1 | `2d39e76d1` | mmc: don't activate LED on status command | `drivers/mmc/core/core.c` (1 line) | **no** (`grep MMC_SEND_STATUS drivers/mmc/core/core.c` → none) | **carry** → `0020-mmc-no-led-on-send-status.patch` |
| F-2 | `b62efee23` | hps_led: brightness-change notification | `drivers/leds/leds-gpio.c` (+9) | **no** | **CARRIED (P1.9)** → `0029-leds-gpio-brightness-hw-changed.patch`. Consumer confirmed: Main_MiSTer polls `brightness_hw_changed` to drive the on-screen disk-activity LED (TASKS.md P1.9 explicit ruling — **do not drop**). Applies clean to 6.18.38, builds warning-free at `W=1`. |
| F-3 | `b2a04cbfd` | vt: reduce 63 → 9 ttys | `include/uapi/linux/vt.h` (`MAX_NR_CONSOLES`) | **no** (it is a local reduction) | **DROPPED (P1.9, confirmed).** TASKS.md P1.9 explicit ruling: a UAPI header edit for a few KB, only 3 consoles used. Not carried; no `00xx` file. |
| F-4 | `7436e2d6e` | mt7601u "possible fix?" — comments out DPD calibration | `drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt7601u/phy.c` | **no** — 6.18 `mt7601u/phy.c:592` still calls `mt76 01u_mcu_calibrate(dev, MCU_CAL_DPD, …)` | **DROPPED (P1.9, confirmed).** Author **bbond007**; commit message is literally *"mt7601u possible fix?"*; the diff comments out a calibration call and leaves stray `/* remove this for testing--> spark2k06 */` markers. Unprincipled, and not in P1.9's task scope. Not carried; re-add only if a real mt7601u regression appears at P3.13. |
| F-5 | `71c583074` *(i2c half)* | Disable RTC error messages | `drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-master.c` (`dev_err`→`dev_dbg` on "controller timed out") | **no** — 6.18 `i2c-designware-master.c:857` still `dev_err` | **carry** → `0030-i2c-designware-quiet-timeout.patch`. Cosmetic: silences boot spam when no RTC add-on board is fitted. *(The m41t80 half of this commit **is** upstream — see class C.)* |

### 3.8 Class G — exfat replacement (NEW class; resolved by ADR 0010 + ADR 0019)

| Commits | Subject | Files | Origin | Upstream | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `8b6b8c2f5`, `df35bdb27`, `858322ce6`, `5220d6686`, `7f7148c1f`, `99a2c80d0` | Remove mainline exFAT; add out-of-tree exFAT **with symlink support**; cleanups | −12 mainline `fs/exfat/*`, +20 files (`exfat_core.c`, `exfat_super.c`, …), `Kconfig`, `Makefile` | Samsung / `exfat-nofuse` lineage, re-integrated by Sorgelig | mainline exfat exists but has **no symlinks** and **no FAT12/16/32** | **Resolved — see N1.** ADR 0010 drops the driver; ADR 0019 restores the symlink format via carried patch `0031` (N1 option (c)). |

### 3.9 Noise

| Commit | Subject | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `a547c18d0` | "remove unused files." — deletes `scripts/gdb/linux/*.py` (15 files, −2,156) | **dismiss.** Deletes upstream kernel GDB helper scripts. No functional effect on the built kernel. Do not carry. |

## 4. Class B analysis — `init/do_mounts.c` (P1.10 depends on this)

Commit `3d95de58f` "Support for init loop device", Sorgelig, 2021-11-08. Two files.

### 4.1 The actual diff

`drivers/block/loop.c` — exports `max_part` so `do_mounts.c` can compute the loop8 minor:

```c
+int loop_max_part(void)
+{

### 4.2 Behaviour, step by step — and whether §5's `/init` covers it

| # | Stock kernel behaviour | Covered by the §5 `/init` sketch? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Parse `loop=` from cmdline (`__setup`) | ✅ yes — `/init` parses `loop=` from `/proc/cmdline` (A2) |
| 2 | `root=` → `/dev/root` via the standard `ROOT_DEV` path; `rootwait` handled by core | ✅ yes — A2 requires parsing `root=` and a `rootwait` retry loop |
| 3 | `mkdir /root2`, mount the data partition there | ✅ yes — `/mnt/fat` |
| 4 | Mount it with fstype **`"exfat"` only** — works for FAT32 *because MiSTer's exfat driver also handles FAT12/16/32* (N1) | ⚠ **partially.** The sketch tries `vfat` then `exfat`, which mounts both — **but via two different mainline drivers.** See §4.3. |
| 5 | Mount flags **`MS_DIRSYNC \| MS_SYNCHRONOUS \| MS_NOATIME \| MS_NODIRATIME`** | ❌ **NOT covered.** The sketch uses default (async) options. **N3 — must add `-o sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime`.** |
| 6 | `create_dev("/dev/loop8", MKDEV(7, (max_part+1)*8))` — with `loop.max_part=8` on the cmdline, `part_shift = fls(8) = 4`, `max_part` becomes 15, so the minor is `16*8 = 128` = loop index 8 << 4. Needed because `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP_MIN_COUNT=8` only pre-creates **loop0–loop7**. | ⚠ **needs care.** BusyBox `losetup /dev/loop8` will fail if the node does not exist. Use `losetup -f` (via `/dev/loop-control`), or `mknod` the node explicitly. **Nothing in userland depends on the root being `loop8` specifically** (verified: no `loop8` reference in `work/imgroot/etc`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, or Main_MiSTer), so `losetup -f` is safe. |
| 7 | `loop_setup()` = `ioctl(LOOP_SET_FD)`; **backing file opened `O_RDWR`**, but the loop device is then mounted with `MS_RDONLY` (from `root_mountflags` + cmdline `ro`) | ✅ yes — `losetup -r` (read-only) + `mount -o ro`. Ours is *stricter*, which is fine and arguably better. |
| 8 | `mount_block_root("/dev/loop8", root_mountflags)` → root = the ext4 in `linux.img`, `ro,noatime,nodiratime` | ✅ yes — `mount -o ro /dev/loopN /newroot` (**add `noatime,nodiratime` for exactness**; moot on a ro mount, but free) |
| 9 | **`init_mount("/root2", "/root/media/fat", "", MS_BIND, "")`** — a **bind** mount, not a move. The data partition therefore stays mounted at `/root2` *as well*. | ⚠ **differs.** The sketch uses `mount --move`. Functionally equivalent for everything that reads `/media/fat`; the only observable difference is one fewer entry in `/proc/mounts`. **Nothing parses `/proc/mounts`** (verified: no `getmntent`/`/proc/mounts`/`mtab` in Main_MiSTer). `mount --move` is cleaner. ✅ acceptable. |
| 10 | **Error paths: every failure just `pr_emerg`s and continues**, ending in a kernel panic ("VFS: Unable to mount root fs"). No recovery. | ✅ **strictly improved** — A2 mandates a diagnostic banner and a serial rescue shell. |
| 11 | `/root2` semantics: an intermediate mountpoint in the initramfs/rootfs, hidden after the switch to `/root`. Not a userland-visible path. | ✅ n/a — no userland reference to `/root2` (verified). |

### 4.3 The one gap that is not a mount option: **symlinks and codepage** (N1)

Step 4 is where §5's plan is *incomplete*, not wrong. Stock mounts the FAT32 **or** exFAT data
partition through **one** driver — MiSTer's out-of-tree exfat — which gives it:

* **symlink support on both FAT32 and exFAT** (used by Main_MiSTer, `file_io.cpp:1592`), and
* **`iocharset=utf8`** filename decoding on both.

The `mount -t vfat || mount -t exfat` fallback routes FAT32 to mainline **vfat** (no symlinks,
`iso8859-1` default) and exFAT to mainline **exfat** (no symlinks). So:

* **Mount options fix the encoding** (`-o iocharset=utf8`) — cheap, do it.
* **Nothing at the initramfs level restores symlinks.** That requires the N1 decision.

**Verdict:** the initramfs replacement covers **100 % of the `loop=` patch's own logic**, and
improves on its error handling. It does **not** cover the *filesystem-driver* substitution that
the class-B patch silently depends on. Deleting `init/do_mounts.c` **from our own image** is
correct and safe; **deleting the exfat driver is a separate decision (N1) that P1.10 must not
assume away.**

This verdict is about the image Buildroot builds. It says nothing about the exported
`Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` tree, which is upstream's kernel for every MiSTer, not just ours, and
carries `3d95de58f` forward-ported to 6.18 for exactly that reason — see §12.

**Action for P1.10:** mount with
`-o ro,sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime,iocharset=utf8` (vfat) /
`-o ro,sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime,iocharset=utf8` (exfat) — noting that `/media/fat` is
mounted **rw** in stock (only the *root* is `ro`), so drop `ro` for the data partition.

## 5. Carried patches — one subsection each

### `0001-fbdev-add-MiSTer_fb-driver.patch` — **P1.4** (class A)

**Origin:** `d1002ecd4` "Implement MiSTer frame buffer device.", Sorgelig, 2021-08-20.
**Files:** `drivers/video/fbdev/MiSTer_fb.c` (new, ~394 lines), `drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig`
(`config FB_MISTER`), `drivers/video/fbdev/Makefile`, and the `MiSTer_fb` DTS node (in `0004`).

**What it does.** A platform driver bound to DT `compatible = "MiSTer_fb"` at
`reg = <0x22000000 0x800000>`, IRQ 40 — the FPGA's frame-reader window. `memremap(...,
MEMREMAP_WT)`s that region and registers it as `/dev/fb0`. The first 4096 bytes are a header;
`screen_base = fb_base + 4096` (`MiSTer_fb.c:265-266`).

**ABI surface — flag loudly for P0.5:**

* **`/dev/fb0`** — standard fbdev node.
* **`FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` ioctl** (`MiSTer_fb.c:111-133`). **This is a *standard mainline* ioctl,
  not a custom number:** `_IOW('F', 0x20, __u32)` — and it is **identical in 5.15 and 6.18**
  (`linux-5.15.1/include/uapi/linux/fb.h:37` ≡ `linux-6.18.38/include/uapi/linux/fb.h:38`).
  Consumer: `Main_MiSTer/video.cpp` ~L3859/3867 `ioctl(fb, FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC, &zero)`.
  **Good news: the ioctl ABI cannot drift.** Any non-`FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` cmd returns `-ENOTTY`;
  a non-zero `arg` value returns `-ENODEV`.
* **`/sys/module/MiSTer_fb/parameters/mode`** (`module_param_cb`, mode **0664**, RW) — the real
  custom ABI. Format is a 5-field string `"%u %u %u %u %u"` = `format rb width height stride`
  (`mode_set()`/`mode_get()`, `MiSTer_fb.c:341-370`). Writing it wipes the framebuffer,
  reconfigures `fb_info`, and bumps `res_count`. Main_MiSTer drives this directly.
* **Read-only params** (0444): `width`, `height`, `stride`, `format`, `rb`, `frame_count`,
  `res_count` under `/sys/module/MiSTer_fb/parameters/`.

**Forward-port hazards on 6.18 — as *predicted*, then as *found***

> **P1.4 is done.** The patch is
> `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches/0001-fbdev-add-MiSTer_fb-driver.patch`
> (3 files, +426: `drivers/video/fbdev/MiSTer_fb.c` new, `Kconfig`, `Makefile`).
> **Disposition: carry — landed.** The patch's own header is the authoritative write-up;
> what follows is the score-card against the predictions made here in Phase 0, because
> **two of the six were wrong** and the wrongness is instructive.

| # | Predicted here | Reality on 6.18.38 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `static struct fb_ops ops` **"must become `const`"** | ❌ **Wrong — not a hazard at all.** `fb_info.fbops` has been `const struct fb_ops *` since **v5.6** (`bf9e25ec1287`), i.e. *already in 5.15*. Assigning a non-`const` object to a pointer-to-`const` is legal C; the 5.15 code compiles unchanged. Constified anyway, as hardening. |
| 2 | `info->flags = FBINFO_FLAG_DEFAULT;` **will not compile** | ✅ **Right.** Removed in **v6.6** by `0444fa357c16`. Assignment deleted. The macro was `0` and `fb_info` sits in a `devm_kzalloc()`'d struct, so this is a no-op, not a behaviour change. |
| 3 | `FBINFO_MISC_USEREVENT` / `fb_notifier_call_chain` — already commented out; `fbcon_update_vcs` survives | ✅ **Right.** No work. |
| 4 | Kconfig: prefer `select FB_SYSMEM_HELPERS` | ❌ **Wrong recommendation** — see 5. `FB_SYSMEM_HELPERS` drags in `FB_SYSMEM_FOPS` (`fb_sys_read`/`fb_sys_write`) **and still leaves the driver with no `mmap`**, because 6.18 has **no sysmem mmap helper** (only `__FB_DEFAULT_SYSMEM_OPS_{RDWR,DRAW}`). Shipped instead: `select FB_SYS_{FILLRECT,COPYAREA,IMAGEBLIT}` (all three still exist) **+ `FB_IOMEM_FOPS`**, plus `depends on OF`. |
| 5 | ⚠ "the single most likely place P1.4 breaks" — sysmem vs iomem fops | ✅ **Right that it was the crux; the resolution is `IOMEM`.** The fallback died in **v6.8**, `8813e86f6d82` ("fbdev: Remove default file-I/O implementations") — a driver with no `.fb_mmap` now takes a `WARN` and `-ENODEV` in `fb_mmap()`. Shipped `__FB_DEFAULT_IOMEM_OPS_RDWR` + `__FB_DEFAULT_IOMEM_OPS_MMAP` (`fb_io_read`/`fb_io_write`/`fb_io_mmap`), which is **exactly what the pre-6.8 core fallback did** — `vm_iomap_memory()` on the physical `fix.smem_start`. It *has* to be iomem: the window is FPGA memory above the `mem=511M` line and **has no `struct page`s**, so a sysmem/`vm_insert_page` mmap could not work. The **drawing** ops stay on `sys_fillrect`/`sys_copyarea`/`sys_imageblit` as in 5.15 — `memremap(MEMREMAP_WT)` returns a normal-memory mapping, so direct dereference is correct there. **Note the premise stated here ("Main_MiSTer maps the framebuffer") is itself false** — see `docs/abi-contract.md` §4.1; only **fbcon** consumes these fops. |
| 6 | No aperture / `remove_conflicting_framebuffers` concern | ✅ **Right.** Platform device, no PCI VGA conflict. Untouched. |

**Two hazards this section did *not* predict**, both found by building:

7. **`platform_driver::remove()` returns `void`** since **v6.11** (`0edb555a65d1`). `fb_remove()`
   changed `int` → `void`; it only ever returned `0`. *(This one bites every carried platform
   driver — **P1.5** and **P1.6** will hit it too.)*
8. **`-Wmissing-prototypes` is on in the default build** since **v6.8** (`0fcb70851fbf`). The
   5.15 file's non-`static` `void fb_set()` is the **only** warning it still emits on 6.18;
   made `static` (it is file-local and was never meant to be a vmlinux-global symbol).

Also fixed, on the error path only, ABI untouched: `memremap()` returns **NULL** on failure, not
an `ERR_PTR`. The 5.15 code tested `IS_ERR()` — false for NULL — so a failed mapping fell
through to `screen_base = 0x1000` and oopsed on the first fbcon draw. Now tests for NULL and
returns `-ENOMEM`.

**Config:** `CONFIG_FB_MISTER=y` was added to `board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` by this task,
as `docs/kernel-config-deltas.md` §4.1 deferred it (kconfig would have discarded the symbol
before the driver existed). `savedefconfig` round-trips with that one line as the only delta.
`CONFIG_FB_DEVICE=y` — the 6.x symbol that creates `/dev/fb0` — must not drift off.

**Verified:** applies clean to pristine 6.18.38 (`git apply --check` and `patch --dry-run`, both
exit 0); full `zImage` builds with **zero compiler diagnostics** at `W=1`
(arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-gcc 14.3.0); `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` = `_IOW('F', 0x20, __u32)` =
**`0x40044620`** evaluated from *both* trees' own headers — identical, and identical on the ARM
target (`movw r1,#0x4620` / `movt r1,#0x4004`); all eight module params present with stock's
names and permissions (`mode` 0664 RW; the seven others 0444 RO), `KBUILD_MODNAME` still
`MiSTer_fb` so the sysfs path is unchanged. **Not verified (needs hardware, → P1.13):** that
IRQ 40 actually fires and `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` returns 0 rather than `-ETIMEDOUT`, and that fbcon
paints.

### `0002-sound-add-MiSTer-audio-spi-and-snd-dummy-MiSTer-model.patch` — **P1.5** (class A) ✅ **LANDED**

**Origin:** `333d49b95` "Implement MiSTer audio driver.", Sorgelig, 2021-08-20 (5 files).
**Files:** `sound/drivers/MiSTer-audio-spi.c` (new), **`sound/drivers/dummy.c` (patched)**,
`sound/drivers/Kconfig` (`config SND_MISTER_AUDIO`), `sound/drivers/Makefile`, DTS (`0004`).

**⚠ Read N4 first — the plan and TASKS.md both mis-state this driver's ABI.**

**What it does — two halves that must ship together:**

1. **`MiSTer-audio-spi.c`**: platform/SPI driver on DT `compatible = "MiSTer,spi-audio"`.
   Allocates a 512 KiB coherent DMA ring (`dma_alloc_coherent`, ~2.6 s of audio), registers a
   char device **`/dev/MrAudio`** (`alloc_chrdev_region` + `class_create` + `device_create` +
   `cdev_add`, `DRIVER_NAME "MrAudio"`), and on `write()` copies PCM into the ring and
   `spi_write()`s the `MrBufferInfo` descriptor (`{addr, ptr, len}`) to the FPGA.
2. **`dummy.c`**: `fake_buffer` `1 → 0` and a `model_MiSTer` (S16_LE / 48000 / 2ch /
   32 KiB) **force-selected** as the default snd-dummy model
   (`dummy->model = m = &model_MiSTer;`). This provides ALSA **card 0**.

**ABI surface — flag loudly for P0.5:**

* **`/dev/MrAudio`** — char device, dynamic major, accepts **raw S16_LE 48 kHz stereo** writes.
* **ALSA card 0** with snd-dummy's *unmodified* names: `card->driver` = `"Dummy"`,
  `shortname` = `"Dummy"`, `longname` = `"Dummy 1"` (`dummy.c:1095-1097`).
* The binding between them is **`/etc/asound.conf`** (rootfs, not kernel): `pcm.!default` is a
  `plug → rate(48000,S16_LE) → file("/dev/MrAudio") → hw:0` chain. **P2.3 must ship this file
  verbatim.**
* `CONFIG_SND_MISTER_AUDIO=y` **and** `CONFIG_SND_DUMMY=y` are both required (stock config +
  HEAD `MiSTer_defconfig`).
* Main_MiSTer itself does **not** open ALSA. Consumers are MidiLink / fluidsynth / mt32 and any
  userland audio program using the default PCM.

**The 5.15 → 6.18 API churn actually hit (P1.5 outcome).** Predictions 2–4 above held:
snd-dummy's structure is intact, `dma_alloc_coherent` is unchanged, and there is no ALSA PCM
churn because this is a chrdev, not an ALSA driver. Prediction 3's "CMA sizing must be
preserved" is void — there is no CMA to size (A12 / abi-contract §8.2: `CONFIG_DMA_CMA` is
*not set*; the 512 KiB comes from the page allocator).

| # | Churn | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `class_create()` lost its `struct module *` arg in **v6.4-rc1** (`1aaba11da9aa`) | `class_create(DRIVER_NAME "_sys")` |
| 2 | `struct spi_driver::remove` became `void` in **v5.18-rc1** (`a0386bba7093`, Uwe Kleine-König) | `static void device_remove(...)` |
| 3 | `class_create()`/`device_create()` return `ERR_PTR()`, never `NULL` — 5.15's `== NULL` tests were **dead code**, so a failed `device_create()` was treated as success | `IS_ERR()` on both; success path bit-for-bit unchanged |
| 4 | `major` was an `int` holding a `dev_t` | now `dev_t`. `ARM_LPAE` is off on Cyclone V ⇒ `dev_t` and `dma_addr_t` are both `u32`; every printk format and printed value is unchanged |

Also: `Kconfig` gained `depends on SPI` (it cannot link without it) and tab indentation;
`model_MiSTer` is now `const` like every other model in `dummy.c` (verified in `.rodata`
alongside `model_emu10k1`/`model_ca0106`). `CONFIG_SND_MISTER_AUDIO` and its `default n` are
unchanged. Everything that is ABI — `DRIVER_NAME "MrAudio"`, the `MrAudio_proc` chrdev region,
the `MrAudio_sys` class, the dynamic major, the 512 KiB ring, the 4-byte write alignment, the
`> BUFFER_LEN ⇒ -EFAULT`, the `Info_t` descriptor, the `read()` status string — is verbatim.

Note the two hazards P1.4 hit do **not** apply here: this is an **SPI** driver, not a platform
driver (so `platform_driver::remove`'s v6.11 `void` change is irrelevant), and every function in
the file is already `static` (so v6.8's default `-Wmissing-prototypes` is satisfied).

**Verified (build-time, actually executed):**

* `git apply --check -p1` against a freshly-extracted pristine v6.18.38 → **clean**; `patch -p1
  --dry-run` likewise (Buildroot applies with `patch(1)`, not git).
* Full `vmlinux` build of the patched pristine tree with the board `linux.config`:
  **zero warnings, zero errors** — and also zero at `W=1`.
* Booted the resulting kernel under `qemu-system-arm -M virt` with a busybox initramfs:
  `/proc/asound/cards` → **card 0 = `Dummy - Dummy / Dummy 1`** (names unmodified, as A12
  requires); `/sys/module/snd_dummy/parameters/fake_buffer` → **`N`** (the patched default).
* Drove card 0's playback PCM through the raw `SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_PARAMS` ABI — exactly what
  libasound's `type hw` plugin does underneath. **S16_LE / 48000 / 2ch is ACCEPTED.** As a
  differential, four triples that an *unpatched* snd-dummy would accept (`U8`, `44100`, mono,
  and a 64 KiB buffer) are all **rejected with `EINVAL`** — proving `model_MiSTer` is genuinely
  force-selected rather than merely present.

#### ⚠ Correction to A12 / N4: *why* the `dummy.c` hunks are load-bearing

A12 and N4 both say card 0 "must accept S16_LE/48000/2ch — otherwise the whole default PCM
fails to open and nothing plays". **That reasoning is wrong, even though the conclusion (ship
the hunks) is right.** An *unpatched* snd-dummy advertises `USE_FORMATS = U8 | S16_LE`,
`USE_RATE = CONTINUOUS 5500..48000`, `channels 1..2` — a **superset**. It would accept
S16_LE/48000/2ch quite happily, and the default PCM would open fine without any `dummy.c`
patch at all. So "otherwise nothing plays" does not follow.

What the hunks actually buy is **pinning**, and the reason is subtle. Read `asound.conf` again:
its `type rate` slave pins `format S16_LE` and `rate 48000` — and **says nothing about the
channel count**. Channels are negotiated against `hw:0`. With stock snd-dummy's `channels 1..2`,
a **mono** client negotiates 1ch all the way down, and the `type file` plugin tees **mono**
S16_LE/48000 into `/dev/MrAudio` — which `MiSTer-audio-spi.c` hands to the FPGA as 4-byte
*stereo* frames (`userBufLen & ~3`). `model_MiSTer`'s `channels_min = channels_max = 2` forces
the top-level `plug` to convert everything to stereo, so `/dev/MrAudio` always sees exactly
S16_LE/48000/2ch. That is the load-bearing effect, and the mono-`EINVAL` above demonstrates it.

**`fake_buffer = 0` is carried for stock parity, and its necessity is UNPROVEN.** A12 says it is
needed "so the dummy card presents a real (if discarded) ring buffer, which the `type file`
chain needs". I could not confirm that: booting the same kernel with `snd_dummy.fake_buffer=1`
on the cmdline produced an **identical** hw_params result (the contract triple still accepted,
the same four still rejected). Mechanically, `fake_buffer=1` selects `dummy_pcm_ops_no_buf`,
whose `.copy` discards and whose `.page` returns one shared page for every offset — which may
well be fine for a pure sink. **We ship 0 because stock ships 0**, which is the right call
regardless; but nobody has demonstrated that 1 breaks anything. If A12's claim matters to
anyone, it needs a real `speaker-test` on hardware to settle. Not a blocker either way.

**NOT verified — needs hardware (route to P1.13):**

* **`/dev/MrAudio` never appears in emulation**, because the driver only probes when an SPI
  device matches `compatible = "MiSTer,spi-audio"` — and that DT node is **P1.7's**
  (`0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch`), deliberately not carried here. Until P1.7 lands, the
  chrdev half of this patch is compiled but never exercised. P1.13 must assert `ls -l
  /dev/MrAudio` → `crw------- root root` (dynamic major, minor 0) and check `dmesg` for
  `MrAudio Audio buffer '/dev/MrAudio' created.`
* The **0600 root:root** mode is by construction, not measurement: the driver sets no `devnode`
  callback, so `devtmpfs_create_node()` applies its `req.mode == 0 ⇒ 0600` default
  (`drivers/base/devtmpfs.c`, **identical in 5.15 and 6.18**), and **no udev rule in the stock
  rootfs matches `SUBSYSTEM=="MrAudio_sys"`** (checked all of `lib/udev/rules.d/`; stock's
  `/dev` is empty of static nodes). So ours is the same as stock's — but neither has been
  *observed*.
* That the FPGA actually plays what is written to the ring (`spi_write()` of `Info_t`), and that
  the 512 KiB order-7 `dma_alloc_coherent()` succeeds at probe time on a 511 MiB machine.
* **End-to-end `/etc/asound.conf`**: `alsa-lib` is not in the Buildroot output yet (P3.8), so
  the full `plug → rate → file → hw:0` chain has not been opened by libasound. Only its
  `slave.pcm { type hw; card 0 }` leg is proved (above). **P1.13/P2.3 must run
  `speaker-test -c2 -r48000 -fS16_LE` and confirm both that it plays and that `/dev/MrAudio`
  receives bytes.**

`.boost_enabled = false` by default; OC is opt-in. It finds the clock manager via
`of_find_compatible_node(NULL, NULL, "altr,clk-mgr")` and reads OSC1 from DT.

**ABI surface:** the **standard cpufreq sysfs** under
`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[01]/cpufreq/`. Main_MiSTer does **not** touch cpufreq (verified — no
`cpufreq`/`scaling_` references); the consumers are community overclock scripts on `/media/fat`.
Stock governor: `CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y` with
performance/powersave/userspace/ondemand/conservative/schedutil all built in (P1.3 must match).

**The 5.15 → 6.18 API churn actually hit (P1.6 outcome). The "low hazard / near-clean rebase"
prediction above was wrong: two of the four items are hard build failures, and the worst one is a
*silent runtime* failure that compiles fine.** Verbatim compiler output from building the
unmodified fork driver against pristine 6.18.38:

```

| # | Churn | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cpufreq_frequency_table_verify()` **lost its `table` argument** — now `(struct cpufreq_policy_data *)` only, reading `policy->freq_table` itself. (§5's "unchanged" was wrong.) | one-arg call |
| 2 | `struct cpufreq_driver::exit()` **returns `void`, not `int`** (`include/linux/cpufreq.h:406`). (§5's ".exit signature unchanged" was wrong.) | `static void socfpga_cpu_exit(...)` |
| 3 | `void inline wait_for_fsm(void)` is `-Wold-style-declaration`, and being non-`static` also trips v6.8's default `-Wmissing-prototypes` | `static void`; `socfpga_cpufreq_clk_mgr_base_addr` made `static` too |
| 4 | **🔥 `scaling_available_frequencies` must be dropped from `->attr`.** Since 6.x `cpufreq_add_dev_interface()` creates it itself for any policy with a `freq_table`. Leaving it in `->attr` makes the core's *second* `sysfs_create_file()` return `-EEXIST`, which **aborts policy creation** — the driver compiles, links, and then simply never registers. **This is invisible at build time.** | `->attr` keeps **only** `cpufreq_freq_attr_scaling_boost_freqs` |

Item 4's asymmetry is the subtle part: the core creates `scaling_boost_frequencies` **only** when
`cpufreq_boost_supported()` (i.e. `->set_boost` non-NULL), which this driver leaves NULL. So that
one *must stay* in `->attr` or the file disappears; and `scaling_available_frequencies` *must go*
or the driver dies. Confirmed correct against `struct cpufreq_driver` in 6.18: `struct freq_attr
**attr` (`:411`) and `bool boost_enabled` (`:416`) do still exist.

**Config:** `CONFIG_ARM_SOCFPGA_CPUFREQ=y` added to `board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` by this
task — P1.3 could not have added it, because the symbol does not exist in vanilla 6.18. Stock
parity confirmed: `work/stock-linux.config:500` has it `=y`, and the stock image's
`usr/lib/modules/5.15.1-MiSTer/modules.builtin:233` lists
`kernel/drivers/cpufreq/socfpga-cpufreq.ko` as **built-in**.

#### ⚠ P1.6 → P1.7 hand-off: the DTS **must** set `osc1`'s rate

The driver reads `/clkmgr@ffd04000/clocks/osc1/clock-frequency` and computes every VCO frequency
from it. **Mainline does not provide it and neither does U-Boot:**

* mainline `socfpga.dtsi` declares `osc1` as a bare `compatible = "fixed-clock"` with **no**
  `clock-frequency`, and **no** mainline Cyclone V board DTS overrides it (checked
  `socfpga_cyclone5_{de10nano,socdk,de0_nano_soc,sockit}.dts` — zero `&osc1` overrides);
* the MiSTer U-Boot has **no** socfpga FDT fixup — no `ft_board_setup`, no
  `CONFIG_OF_BOARD_SETUP`, no `fdt_setprop`/`do_fixup` anywhere under `arch/arm/mach-socfpga/`,
  `board/altera/`, `board/terasic/`;
* but the **stock DTB does carry it**: `work/stock.dts:107-112` → `clock-frequency = <0x17d7840>`
  = **25,000,000**. (Consistent with the driver's own comments: *"25 MHz * (95 + 1) = 2400 MHz"*.)

⇒ ~~**`0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch` (P1.7) must add `&osc1 { clock-frequency = <25000000>; };`**~~

**[P1.7, 2026-07-12 — RETRACTED. No DTS change is needed; `0004` adds nothing for `osc1`.]**
`osc1` *is* the root of the entire gen5 clock tree, and it *does* carry the 25 MHz rate — but it
already does so, in **both** trees, via the SoC-family include rather than the board file:

| | file | line | value |
|---|---|---|---|
| fork (5.15) | `arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi` | 15-17 | `osc1 { clock-frequency = <25000000>; }` |
| mainline 6.18.38 | `arch/arm/boot/dts/intel/socfpga/socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi` | 13-18 | `osc1 { clock-frequency = <25000000>; }` |

Both board DTSes `#include` that file. The search that produced this open item looked at
`socfpga.dtsi` (where `osc1` is declared **rateless**, 6.18 line 124) and at the board `.dts`,
and missed the `socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi` layer in between. **This also closes the "open item"
below** — nothing is injected by the MiSTer release build; the property was in the fork's DTS
sources all along.

**Verified against the artifacts, not the sources:** `dtc -I dtb -O dts` on `work/stock.dtb` and
on the DTB built from `0004` both yield
`osc1 { #clock-cells = <0x00>; clock-frequency = <0x17d7840>; compatible = "fixed-clock"; }`
— `0x17d7840` = 25,000,000, byte-identical. See `docs/dts-comparison.md` §4.1.

**Why not `cpufreq-dt` + OPP tables?** (the honest upstream check — the preferred outcome would
have been to *drop* this patch)

**It cannot work, because the mainline gen5 socfpga clock driver is read-only:**

* **No `.set_rate` op exists anywhere in it.** `grep -n set_rate drivers/clk/socfpga/{clk,clk-gate,clk-pll,clk-periph}.c` → **no matches**. `clk_pll_ops` and `periclk_ops` are `{ .recalc_rate }` only; `gateclk_ops` adds only `.determine_rate`/`.get_parent`/`.set_parent`. `clk_set_rate()` on the MPU clock therefore **cannot change the frequency** — which is exactly what `cpufreq-dt` needs. `socfpga_clk_determine_rate()` even ignores the requested rate and returns `best_parent_rate / div`, i.e. the *current* rate.
* The `cpu@0`/`cpu@1` nodes in `socfpga.dtsi` have **no `clocks` property**, so `cpufreq-dt`'s `clk_get(cpu_dev)` would fail `-ENOENT` regardless.
* Nothing named `altr`/`socfpga` appears in `cpufreq-dt-platdev.c`'s allowlist.
* Structurally, an OPP row ("one clock + one regulator") **cannot express this transition**: four clocks derived from one VCO (`mpuclk`, `mainclk`, `dbgatclk`, `cfgs2fuser0clk`) must be reprogrammed as a single order-dependent sequence — bypass the main PLL, then apply dividers and VCO in an order that depends on whether the target VCO is above or below the current one — while holding `mainclk`/`dbgatclk` at 400 MHz and `cfgs2fuser0clk` at 100 MHz.

Supporting `cpufreq-dt` would mean **adding `.set_rate`/`.determine_rate` to a clock driver shared
by every Cyclone V board** — a far larger, riskier change than carrying a self-contained
out-of-tree driver, and untestable without hardware. **Verdict: carry the patch.** There is no
mainline commit that supersedes it; mainline has no socfpga cpufreq driver at all
(`grep -rin 'socfpga\|altera\|altr' drivers/cpufreq/` in 6.18.38 → **no matches**).

#### Known latent bug — **deliberately preserved, not fixed**

`wait_for_fsm()` calls `wait_on_bit(word, bit, mode)` with an `__iomem` pointer and passes
`CLKMGR_STAT_BUSY` — a **mask** (`BIT(0)` == 1) — where a **bit number** is expected. It therefore
polls **bit 1** of `CLKMGR_STAT`, not bit 0 (BUSY). `wait_on_bit()` also does a plain `test_bit()`
on MMIO rather than `readl()`, and if the bit were ever observed set it would sleep
`TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` on a wait queue **that no hardware can ever wake**. In practice it returns
immediately and PLL settling is covered by register-write latency — which is why the stock kernel
works. Fixing it changes PLL transition timing, which **cannot be validated without a DE10-Nano on
the bench**; a forward-port is the wrong place to smuggle in an untested change to clock
sequencing. Carried verbatim, flagged for hardware bring-up (P1.13).

**Verified (build-time, actually executed):**

* `git apply --check -v` against a freshly-extracted pristine v6.18.38 → **clean** (exit 0);
  `patch -p1 --dry-run` (Buildroot's applier) likewise → **clean** (exit 0).
* From pristine: apply → `olddefconfig` (symbol survives) → `make W=1
  drivers/cpufreq/socfpga-cpufreq.o` → **zero warnings, zero errors**.
* Full `zImage` build of the patched tree with the board `linux.config`: **zero warnings, zero
  errors**; driver confirmed linked in — `nm vmlinux` shows
  `__initcall__kmod_socfpga_cpufreq__213_380_socfpga_cpufreq_init6`, `socfpga_cpufreq_driver`,
  `socfpga_target_index`, `socfpga_get`.

**Not verified (needs hardware):** that the PLL actually retimes and the board is stable at
1.0/1.2 GHz; the `wait_for_fsm()` bit above. No DE10-Nano was available.

### `0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch` — **P1.7** (class A, 13 commits)

**Origin:** `aa8afe109` (base DTS) + 12 follow-ups. **Files:**
`arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_cyclone5_de10_nano.dts` (fork) → to be re-based on mainline's
`arch/arm/boot/dts/intel/socfpga/socfpga_cyclone5_de10nano.dts` (present in 6.18; introduced by
**`144616a80889`** *ARM: dts: socfpga: Add basic support for Terrasic's de10-nano*, 2025-02-03),
plus **one hunk in `arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga.dtsi`**.

**Everything the fork's DTS adds** (full node list — diff against mainline node-by-node in
`docs/dts-comparison.md`, do **not** work from memory):

|---|---|
| `chosen` | `bootargs = "earlyprintk"`, `stdout-path = "serial0:115200n8"` |
| `memory` | `reg = <0x0 0x40000000>` (1 GB; cmdline `mem=511M` overrides) |
| `regulator_3_3v` | `regulator-fixed`, 3.3 V |
| `leds` | `gpio-leds`, `hps0` → label **`hps_led0`**, `gpios = <&portb 24 0>`, `linux,default-trigger = "mmc0"` |
| `i2c_gpio` | `i2c-gpio` bus on `&portb 22/23` (open-drain), `delay-us = <2>`; children `pcf8563@0x51`, `m41t81@0x68`, `mcp7941x@0x6F` (RTC add-on board) |
| `MiSTer_fb` | `compatible = "MiSTer_fb"`, `reg = <0x22000000 0x800000>`, `interrupts = <0 40 1>`, `interrupt-parent = <&intc>` |
| `&gmac1` | `status=okay`, `phy-mode = "rgmii"`, all 12 `*-skew-ps` values, **`max-frame-size = <3800>`** |
| `&gpio0/1/2` | enabled |
| `&i2c0` | `speed-mode = <0>`, `adxl345@53` |
| `&i2c2` | enabled, `clock-frequency = <100000>`, `speed-mode = <0>` |
| `&spi0` | `timeouts = <3>`; child `spiusb@0` → `compatible = "MiSTer,spi-audio"`, 10 MHz, `spi-cpha`, `spi-cpol` |
| `&spi1` | `timeouts = <3>`; child `spibri@0` → `compatible = "altspi"`, 25 MHz → `/dev/spidev1.0` (**§13 / N2**) |

| `&uart0`, `&uart1` | enabled, **`/delete-property/ dmas` + `dma-names`** (DW UART DMA is broken) |
| `&usb1` | **`disable-over-current`**, `dr_mode = "host"` |
| `&fpga_bridge0/1/2` | enabled |
| **`socfpga.dtsi`** | `i2c1`: `clock-frequency = <100000>` — ⚠ **a change to the shared SoC dtsi, not the board DTS.** Decide at P1.7 whether to move it into the board file (preferred — keeps the patch off a shared file) or carry the dtsi hunk. |

**Hazards:** mainline's DTS lives at a different path (`intel/socfpga/…de10nano.dts`, no
underscore) and includes `socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi`; node names/labels are stable. `dtc` in 6.18 is
stricter — expect new warnings on the unit-address-less nodes (`MiSTer_fb`, `i2c_gpio`,
`leds`) and on `rtc_at_51`-style names without `@reg`. `071d9092e` already did one round of
warning-fixing on 5.15; expect another.

#### ✅ DONE — P1.7, 2026-07-12 (Michael C. Ferguson)

Shipped as `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches/0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch`.
**Re-authored** on top of mainline's board DTS, not replayed. Full node-by-node evidence:
**`docs/dts-comparison.md`**. Resolutions to the open questions above:

* **The `socfpga.dtsi` hunk is NOT carried.** `i2c1` is `disabled` on this board in stock
  *and* in ours, so its `clock-frequency` is never read (probe never runs). Dropping it keeps
  patch `0004` off a file shared by every socfpga board — the option P0.4 marked "preferred".
* **`dtc`: zero new warnings**, at default `DTC_FLAGS` *and* at `W=1` (baseline: 0 / 5 —
  the 5 are pre-existing `simple_bus_reg` complaints in the shared `socfpga.dtsi`). The
  predicted `unit_address_vs_reg` warnings were real; fixed by giving `MiSTer_fb` and the
  three RTC nodes unit addresses (`MiSTer_fb@22000000`, `rtc@51/68/6f`). Both renames are
  provable no-ops — drivers match on `compatible`, and `of_device_make_bus_id()` builds the
  platform-device name from the translated `reg` + `%pOFn` (unit address stripped),
  `drivers/of/device.c:298-305`.
* **Dead properties dropped:** `speed-mode` (i2c0/i2c2) and `timeouts` (spi0/spi1) — a
  whole-tree `grep` of 6.18 for either string in `*.c`/`*.h` returns **zero hits**. Bus speed
  is unchanged (100 kHz on both i²C buses, as stock).
* **`aliases { ethernet0 = &gmac1; }` is load-bearing** and is carried: U-Boot's
  `fdt_fixup_ethernet()` (`common/fdt_support.c:470`, called from `image_setup_libfdt()`
  `common/image-fdt.c:497`) uses it to inject `$ethaddr`. Mainline's dtsi does not have it.
* **A14 (the HDMI killer) is proven**, not assumed: exactly **three** i²C adapters
  (`i2c0`, `i2c2`, `i2c_gpio` — byte-identically stock's), **no `i2c` aliases**, so
  `i2c_add_adapter()` takes the dynamic path and `idr_alloc()`s from
  `__i2c_first_dynamic_bus_num == 0` ⇒ the only possible numbers are **{0, 1, 2}**. No
  adapter can be numbered ≥ 3. Full argument, including probe order and the
  `I2C_DESIGNWARE_PLATFORM` config dependency, in `docs/dts-comparison.md` §2.
* **`osc1` needs no hunk.** `socfpga.dtsi:124` declares it rateless, but
  `socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi:13-18` — which the board DTS includes — sets
  `clock-frequency = <25000000>`. The built DTB is byte-identical to stock here (`0x17d7840`).

### `0005-spidev-accept-altspi-compatible.patch` — **P1.8** (class A, §13 / N2)

**Origin:** `246984fce` "Enable SPI on LTC. Use HPS LED for SD card activity.", Sorgelig,
2018-02-06. **File:** `drivers/spi/spidev.c` — one line added to `spidev_dt_ids[]`.

**Consumer:** `Main_MiSTer/brightness.cpp` opens **`/dev/spidev1.0`** (I/O-board brightness).

**The hazard, precisely.** 6.18's spidev binds **only** compatibles in `spidev_dt_ids[]`
(`6.18 drivers/spi/spidev.c:720`). An `altspi` node not listed there **never probes** →
`/dev/spidev1.0` never appears → brightness control silently dies. (`spidev_of_check()` at
`:711` is a *different* guard — it only rejects the literal string `"spidev"` in DT.)

**Preferred fix (P1.8):** change the DTS `compatible` to one 6.18 already accepts and drop this
patch entirely. We ship our own DTB, so nothing breaks. **Fallback:** re-add the one-liner; note
6.18's entries carry `.data = &spidev_of_check`, and an entry *without* `.data` is safe because
`spidev_probe()` (`:763`) only invokes the callback when `device_get_match_data()` is non-NULL.

**Assert in P1.13's boot log:** `/dev/spidev1.0` exists.

#### ❌ DROPPED — resolved by P1.7, 2026-07-12. This patch does not exist and never will.

The "preferred fix" was taken. `0004-…`'s `spi1` child uses
**`compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv"`**, which is already in 6.18's `spidev_dt_ids[]` *and*
`spidev_spi_ids[]`, so spidev probes it with a stock kernel and no `drivers/spi/spidev.c`
hunk is needed. Rationale for that particular string (it is the de-facto mainline
"userspace-driven SPI slave" placeholder; `spidev_of_check()` only rejects the literal
`"spidev"`; the real device is an add-on **hub** — brightness/lid,
`Main_MiSTer/brightness.cpp` — which no in-table compatible describes anyway) is in
`docs/dts-comparison.md` §5, together with the proof that the node still lands on **SPI bus
1, CS 0 ⇒ `/dev/spidev1.0`** (no `spi` aliases ⇒ `spi_register_controller()` numbers
controllers dynamically in probe order, exactly as on stock).

**§6's patch list therefore has no `0005`.** The numbering gap is intentional — do not
renumber `0010`+ to close it.

### `0010`–`0030` — classes D & F ✅ **P1.9 LANDED (partial — see escalations)**

Per-patch detail is in the §3.4 and §3.7 tables (origin, files, upstream evidence, target
filename). Owner: **P1.9** ([SONNET]). Done 2026-07-12 by Michael C. Ferguson, working tree
`work/k-hid/` (pristine 6.18.38). 15 of 18 planned patches carried; 3 escalated. Full kernel
build (`zImage` + `modules`) with the final `board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` (which now
also carries the new `CONFIG_HID_GUNCON2/3`, `CONFIG_HID_FTEC`,
`CONFIG_HID_GAMECUBE_ADAPTER(_FF)`, `CONFIG_HID_VADER4=m` lines this task's drivers need):
**zero warnings, zero errors.** All 18 landed patches verified with `git apply --check`
against a pristine 6.18.38 tree, both individually and as the full ordered series.

**Carried (18 files, `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches/`):**
`0010-hid-guncon2.patch`, `0011-hid-guncon3.patch`, `0012-hid-fanatec.patch`,
`0013-hid-flydigi-vader.patch`, `0014-hid-gamecube-adapter.patch`,
`0016-hid-microsoft-elite2-paddles.patch`, `0017-xpad-mister-deltas.patch`,
`0018-hid-controllable-quirk.patch`, `0019-hidpp-k400-fn-inversion.patch`,
`0020-mmc-no-led-on-send-status.patch`, `0022-hid-playstation-ds4-mac-fix.patch`,
`0023-hid-wiimote-fixes.patch`, `0024-hid-input-keyrah-europe1.patch`,
`0025-usbhid-jspoll-gamepad.patch`, `0027-mt76x2u-release-xbox-adapter-ids.patch`,
`0028-dwc2-fix-unaligned-in-split.patch`, `0029-leds-gpio-brightness-hw-changed.patch`,
`0030-i2c-designware-quiet-timeout.patch`. Every file carries a full provenance header
(origin commit(s)/URL, author, upstream status, forward-port notes, `Signed-off-by`).

**New findings during the port (P0.4 re-verification, per task instructions):**

* **`1412bd707` (hid-sony div-by-0, folded into old `0022`) is superseded upstream**, not by a
  byte-identical fix but a *better* one: `hid-playstation.c`'s DualSense/DualShock4 calibration
  setup now sanity-checks every `sens_denom` for zero at calibration-parse time (init-time
  guard with a safe fallback) instead of the fork's per-report-parse ternary. Dropped.
* **`5c410e935` (hid-sony 3rd-party DS4 wired-connect fix) is NOT superseded, but its target
  moved.** DualShock4 handling was split out of `hid-sony.c` into the new upstream
  `hid-playstation.c` (`dualshock4_get_mac_address()`), which has the identical
  hard-fail-on-read-error bug in its new home. Re-targeted; carried as
  `0022-hid-playstation-ds4-mac-fix.patch` (renamed from the planned
  `0022-hid-sony-fixes.patch`).
* **Class C's three explicitly-named "carry" items in the P1.9 task text are all confirmed
  still upstream-superseded** (re-verified directly against `work/k-hid`, not re-derived from
  this document): usb-storage Realtek CD-ROM blacklist (`unusual_devs.h:1509`, exact IDs
  `0x0bda,0x1a2b`), btusb TP-Link UB500 (`btusb.c:787`, `0x2357,0x0604`), btusb Edimax BT-8500
  (`btusb.c:797`, `0x7392,0xc611`). Not carried, no `00xx` file — matches §3.3's original
  triage exactly.
* **`hid-microsoft`'s device-table macro was renamed upstream**:
  `USB_DEVICE_ID_MS_XBOX_ELITE2_CONTROLLER` (fork, 5.15) →
  `USB_DEVICE_ID_MS_XBOX_CONTROLLER_MODEL_1797_BLE` (6.18) — same numeric ID (`0x0b22`).
  `0016` retargets to the new name.
* **Two API removals hit twice each, not predicted by P0.4:** `usb_maxpacket()` dropped its
  3rd (direction) argument (hit in `0011`); `hrtimer_init()` + assigning `->function` was
  replaced by a single `hrtimer_setup()` call, v6.12 (hit in `0012`, matching what P1.4
  independently found for a *different* API,
  `platform_driver::remove()` returning `void` — the general pattern of "helper signature
  simplified by folding two calls into one" recurs across subsystems in this kernel gap).
  `hid_is_using_ll_driver(hdev, &usb_hid_driver)` was removed entirely (`usb_hid_driver` became
  file-static once the USB-specific `hid_is_usb()` helper landed, v5.2) — hit in `0014`.
  `hidpp_root_get_feature()` dropped its `feature_type` output parameter, and `k400_connect()`
  dropped its `bool connected` parameter — both hit in `0019`.
* **A latent bug found and fixed while porting `0019`:** the fork's own K400-Fn-inversion patch
  reused `k400->feature_index` (already claimed by `k400_disable_tap_to_click()`'s HID++
  feature cache) for the unrelated Fn-inversion feature lookup too. Whichever call ran second
  would see a stale non-zero index and skip its own lookup, sending its `SetFeature` command at
  the wrong feature index. Given a dedicated `fn_feature_index` field instead of sharing.

**Escalated to [OPUS] — not ported, left as `.c` in the fork only.**
**➡ ALL THREE NOW RESOLVED — see §9 for the [OPUS] dispositions** (`0026` and `0015` landed;
`0021` deliberately not carried). P1.9's escalation reasoning below is preserved as written,
including the parts §9 corrects (`0021`'s "orphaned `G920` ID" claim is **wrong** — see §9.3).

* **`0026-input-mousedev-eviocgrab.patch`** — out of scope for P1.9 by design (TASKS.md P1.9
  explicit ruling: not a HID quirk, a core input-subsystem patch). Not attempted here. See
  original analysis below (unchanged from P0.4).
* **`0015-hid-nintendo-nso-famicom.patch`** (`484f68172`, NSO Famicom controllers) — **new
  finding: upstream `hid-nintendo.c` was substantially reorganized** since the fork's 5.15
  base (2,564 → 2,853 lines). The fork's patch is written against a macro-based type-detection
  idiom (`#define jc_type_is_nescon(ctlr) (...)`, `jc_type_is_joycon`, `jc_type_is_nso`,
  `jc_has_rumble`); 6.18 replaced every one of those macros with `static inline bool
  joycon_type_is_*()` helper functions with different names and different combining logic
  (e.g. `joycon_type_is_any_nescon()` merges what were separate left/right macros), and the
  `jc_type_is_nso`/`jc_has_rumble` macros have no direct successor — their logic is now spread
  across the refactored helpers. Porting Famicom support (`JOYCON_CTLR_TYPE_FAMIL/FAMIR`, new
  `jc_type_is_famircon`-equivalent, button-input-array wiring, mic-capability exclusion per the
  commit's "no mic for Famicom R" note) correctly requires understanding this new scheme
  end-to-end, not a mechanical port. **Flagged for [OPUS] per the P1.9 escalation rule**
  ("stop on that one... rather than forcing it").
* **`0021-hid-lg4ff-g923.patch`** (`8a100f2ed` + `43c52e9ef`, G923 wheels + 32-bit rumble/FF
  fix) — **new finding: depends entirely on an out-of-tree architecture that never landed
  upstream.** The fork's `8a100f2ed` is itself a ~2,000-line wholesale rewrite of
  `hid-lg4ff.c` (1,500 → 2,378+ lines) pulling in Bernat Arlandis's well-known out-of-tree
  memless-FF-timer "new-lg4ff" project (hrtimer-driven slot scheduler, mirroring the same
  pattern as `0012`'s Fanatec driver). **6.18's `hid-lg4ff.c` is still the pre-2019 old-style
  driver** (1,500 lines, no `hrtimer`, no `LG4FF_VERSION`) — the rewrite was never merged
  upstream. Confirmed `USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_G920_WHEEL` (already in `hid-ids.h`) is an
  **orphaned ID**: not referenced anywhere in `hid-lg4ff.c` or `hid-lg.c`, meaning even G920
  wheel support is not actually wired up in mainline today, let alone G923. Adding just the
  `hid-lg.c` device-table entries (the smaller, separable half of `43c52e9ef`) without a
  matching `lg4ff_devices[]` entry would make `lg4ff_init()` hard-fail
  (`hid_err(...); error = -1;`) on probe — the wheel wouldn't even come up as a plain gamepad.
  A correct, minimal port requires hand-authoring a `lg4ff_devices[]` entry (effects/range/
  mode-switch tables) against the *old* architecture from protocol knowledge, not a diff
  replay. Given force feedback on a physical steering wheel is safety/feel-sensitive and the
  actual fix (the 32-bit rumble bug) is inseparable from the rewritten architecture, **flagged
  for [OPUS]** rather than shipping a half-working wheel driver.

**Carried against the provenance doc's own suggestion — reviewed and overturned:**

* **`0028-dwc2-fix-unaligned-in-split.patch`** was flagged above (original analysis, preserved
  below for the record) for **[OPUS]** escalation on the theory that "a real bug fix, not a
  quirk" needed more careful handling. Hands-on inspection during P1.9 found
  `dwc2_hc_xfercomp_intr()` / `dwc2_xfercomp_isoc_split_in()` structurally **unchanged** since
  5.15 (same `dwc2_get_actual_xfer_length()` helper, same call sites, same context) — no
  upstream reorganization to navigate. Carried as a normal mechanical port instead of
  escalating; see the P1.9 report for the full reasoning. *(Original P0.4 analysis, for
  the record: "a real dwc2 bug fix, not a quirk. Moves the `align_buf` bounce-buffer `memcpy`
  out of `dwc2_xfercomp_isoc_split_in()` and gates it on `chan->align_buf && chan->ep_is_in &&
  qtd->complete_split`, using `dwc2_get_actual_xfer_length()` instead of `len`. 6.18 still has
  the old code (`hcd_intr.c:922-928`). Recommend submitting upstream — it benefits every dwc2
  user, and upstreaming it removes a carried patch permanently." That upstream-submission
  recommendation still stands independently of this fork.)*
* **`0017-xpad-mister-deltas.patch`** was flagged above for possible escalation
  ("do not port the [wholesale-sync] commit; port the MiSTer-specific deltas... the delta is
  genuinely small"). Confirmed small and non-restructured on inspection — all four target
  functions/tables (`xpad_device[]`, `xpad_probe()`, `xpad_init_output()`,
  `xpad360_process_packet()`, `xpad_init_input()`, `xpad_disconnect()`) are structurally
  unchanged from the fork's 5.15 base. Carried in full, including the ~230-line Flydigi V2
  raw-mode client for the Vader 5 Pro. **HW verification pending (flag for P3.13):** the
  Flydigi V2 protocol implementation and the GIP-exclusion/xone hand-off are ported faithfully
  but not bench-tested against real hardware here.

## 6. Mapping onto PLAN §6's `linux-patches/` filenames

§6 lists 10 files. The verified triage needs **more**, because §6's class D/F list is
incomplete. Proposed final set (P1.9 confirms):

| §6 planned | Status |
|---|---|
| `0001-fbdev-add-MiSTer_fb-driver.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.4)** — as planned. Applies clean to 6.18.38, builds warning-free at `W=1`. Also carries `CONFIG_FB_MISTER=y` into `linux.config`. See §5. |
| `0002-sound-add-MiSTer-audio-spi-and-snd-dummy-MiSTer-model.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.5)** — renamed from `0002-sound-add-MiSTer-audio-spi.patch` because it **does** carry the `dummy.c` hunks (N4), and the name should say so. Applies clean to 6.18.38, builds warning-free at `W=1`. Also carries `CONFIG_SND_MISTER_AUDIO=y` into `linux.config`. See §5. |
| `0003-cpufreq-cyclone5-de10nano-overclock.patch` | ✅ carried (P1.6). Renamed from `0003-cpufreq-cyclone5-overclock.patch`. `cpufreq-dt`/OPP **cannot** replace it (gen5 clk driver has no `.set_rate`). Two hard API breaks + one silent `-EEXIST` sysfs trap fixed. ~~Requires P1.7 to add `&osc1 { clock-frequency = <25000000>; }`.~~ **[P1.7: no DTS change needed — claim retracted.]** P1.6 read only `socfpga.dtsi:124` (where `osc1` is declared rateless); **`socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi:13-18`**, which the board DTS `#include`s, already sets `clock-frequency = <25000000>`. Verified in the **built DTB**: `osc1 { clock-frequency = <0x17d7840>; }` — byte-identical to `stock.dtb`. Stock's DTS also has **no** OPP/`operating-points` nodes anywhere, consistent with carrying the driver. |
| `0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.7)** — re-authored on mainline's board DTS. **Zero new `dtc` warnings** (default *and* `W=1`); built DTB decompiled and diffed node-by-node against `stock.dtb`. The `socfpga.dtsi` i2c1 hunk is **not carried** (i2c1 is `disabled`; the property is never read) — patch stays off the shared SoC file. **A14 proven**: exactly 3 i²C adapters, no `i2c` aliases ⇒ numbers can only be {0,1,2}. See `docs/dts-comparison.md`. |
| `0005-spidev-accept-altspi-compatible.patch` | ❌ **DROPPED — eliminated by P1.7.** The DTS uses `compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv"`, already in 6.18's `spidev_dt_ids[]`, so no kernel hunk is needed. Node still lands on bus 1 CS 0 ⇒ `/dev/spidev1.0`. The `0005` slot stays empty — **do not renumber**. See §5 and `docs/dts-comparison.md` §5. |
| `0010-hid-guncon2.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — as planned. Applies clean to 6.18.38, builds warning-free at `W=1`. |
| `0011-hid-guncon3.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — `usb_maxpacket()` 3-arg→2-arg forward-port fix (see §5 below). |
| `0012-hid-fanatec.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — `hrtimer_init()`→`hrtimer_setup()` forward-port fix (see §5). |
| `0013-hid-flydigi-vader.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — unmodified (the `hid-vader4.c` BT driver; the *xpad* Vader work is `0017`) |
| `0020-usb-storage-blacklist-realtek-cdrom.patch` | ❌ **DELETE — upstream, confirmed (P1.9)** (`a3dc32c635ba`; re-verified directly against `work/k-hid`: `unusual_devs.h:1509`) |
| `0014-hid-gamecube-adapter.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — Nintendo WUP-028 (057e:0337). `hid_is_using_ll_driver()`→`hid_is_usb()` forward-port fix. |
| `0015-hid-nintendo-nso-famicom.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9-esc, [OPUS])** — re-implemented against 6.18's typed-helper + `joycon_ctlr_button_mapping` scheme; the 5.15 diff applies in no form. Builds warning-free at `W=1`. See §9. |
| `0016-hid-microsoft-elite2-paddles.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — Elite 2 paddles over BT. Device-table macro renamed upstream (`USB_DEVICE_ID_MS_XBOX_ELITE2_CONTROLLER`→`..._MODEL_1797_BLE`, same ID). |
| `0017-xpad-mister-deltas.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — cpoll, GIP exclusions, Vader 3/4/5 Pro (incl. the full Flydigi V2 raw-mode client), Qanba. Confirmed non-restructured on inspection; carried in full rather than escalated. HW verification pending, flag for P3.13. |
| `0018-hid-controllable-quirk.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — 1209:FACA, unmodified. |
| `0019-hidpp-k400-fn-inversion.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — K400r / K400 Plus. `hidpp_root_get_feature()`/`k400_connect()` signature forward-port fixes; also fixed a latent feature-index cache-sharing bug in the fork's own patch (see §5). |
| `0020-mmc-no-led-on-send-status.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — *(number freed by the deletion above)*, unmodified. |
| `0021-hid-lg4ff-g923.patch` | ❌ **NOT CARRIED — deliberate (P1.9-esc, [OPUS]).** No `00xx` file. The G923 *Xbox* variant is already fully supported upstream by `hid-logitech-hidpp`; the G923 *PlayStation* variant would need ~120 lines of never-executed, hardware-untestable FF-wheel plumbing whose failure mode is a wheel with **no driver at all**. Narrow, documented regression accepted. Full reasoning + a complete recipe for whoever has the hardware: §9. |
| `0022-hid-playstation-ds4-mac-fix.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)**, renamed from `0022-hid-sony-fixes.patch`. DS4 support (incl. MAC-address retrieval) moved from `hid-sony.c` to the new upstream `hid-playstation.c`; div-by-0 half dropped (already superseded upstream by init-time `sens_denom` guards); 3rd-party-wired-DS4 half re-targeted to `dualshock4_get_mac_address()`. |
| `0023-hid-wiimote-fixes.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — uniq, buttons, analog. Also extended the uniq fix to `wiimod_turntable_probe()` (a module added upstream after the fork's 5.15 base). |
| `0024-hid-input-keyrah-europe1.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — Europe-1 → `KEY_F24`, byte-identical. |
| `0025-usbhid-jspoll-gamepad.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — jspoll for gamepads, unmodified (dropped 3 unconditional debug `pr_info()`s). |
| `0026-input-mousedev-eviocgrab.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9-esc, [OPUS])** — the one that mattered: without it a USB mouse dies the instant a core launches. `input_pass_values()` rewritten against 6.18's `->handle_events()` + `scoped_guard(rcu)`; the name-prefix hack replaced by an explicit `input_handler->ignore_grab` opt-in. Builds warning-free at `W=1`. See §9. |
| `0027-mt76x2u-release-xbox-adapter-ids.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — let xone bind 045e:02e6/02fe, unmodified. |
| `0028-dwc2-fix-unaligned-in-split.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — carried, not escalated. See §5 for why this overturns the earlier `[OPUS]`/"submit upstream" recommendation; upstream submission is still separately worth doing. |
| `0029-leds-gpio-brightness-hw-changed.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — consumer confirmed (Main_MiSTer polls it for the disk-activity LED), kept per explicit Phase 0 ruling. |
| `0030-i2c-designware-quiet-timeout.patch` | ✅ **landed (P1.9)** — cosmetic, forward-ported to the new `i2c_dw_wait_transfer()` call site. |
| *(pending N1 decision)* `00xx-exfat-*` | **class G — see N1** |

**Dropped relative to §6/§4.1:** the `loop=` patch (class B, by design), 22 class-C commits +
1 more found by P1.9 (`1412bd707` div-by-0, superseded by init-time guards in
`hid-playstation.c`), the `dwc2/core.c` no-op (N5, **confirmed dropped P1.9** — owned by
`0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer.patch`/P1.7, which must carry only the DTS half of `077c2c317`),
`vt.h` (F-3, **confirmed dropped P1.9**), and `mt7601u` (F-4, **confirmed dropped P1.9**).

## 7. Open questions / risks for the P0.9 review gate

| # | Question | Severity | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | **exfat (N1): (a) accept losing symlinks on `/media/fat`, (b) forward-port the out-of-tree driver, or (c) add `ATTR_SYSTEM` symlink support to mainline exfat?** Main_MiSTer actively resolves symlinks (`file_io.cpp:1592`). Nothing in the plan budgets this. | **HIGH** | P0.9 → P1.3/P1.10 |
| **Q2** | Does anything in the community actually *use* symlinks on `/media/fat`? If a survey says no, Q1 collapses to (a) + a release note. **Needs a human/community answer — I cannot determine it from the repos.** | **HIGH** | human |
| **Q3** | `/media/fat` mount options (N3): replicate `sync,dirsync`, or deliberately switch to async and document the power-off-corruption trade-off? | MEDIUM | P1.10 |
| **Q4** | FAT32 `iocharset`: stock is effectively `utf8`; mainline vfat defaults to `iso8859-1`. Set `-o iocharset=utf8` (and/or `CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_UTF8=y`)? | MEDIUM | P1.3/P1.10 |
| **Q5** | ~~btusb CSR clones (`b02a4a011`)~~ **DECIDED (2026-07-15):** detection half **carried** as `0036-btusb-csr-clone-lmp-subver-2512.patch` (match-stock decision); the fork's Barrot pm_runtime narrowing is superseded by 6.18's reworked CSR handling. HW confirmation on a real 0x2512 clone still welcome. | ~~MEDIUM~~ done | ~~P3.13~~ |
| **Q6** | ~~`leds-gpio` `brightness_hw_changed` (F-2): no consumer found in Main_MiSTer. Confirm at P0.5, then drop if truly unused.~~ **DECIDED (P1.9):** consumer confirmed (Main_MiSTer polls it for the disk-activity LED per TASKS.md P1.9's explicit ruling) — kept, carried as `0029-leds-gpio-brightness-hw-changed.patch`. | LOW | ~~P0.5~~ done |
| **Q7** | ~~`mt7601u` DPD hack (F-4) and `vt.h` (F-3): recommend dropping both. Confirm.~~ **DECIDED (P1.9):** both confirmed dropped per TASKS.md P1.9's explicit ruling (`vt.h`) and P1.9's own judgment, out of task scope (`mt7601u`, F-4's "unprincipled" assessment stands). | LOW | ~~P0.9~~ done |
| **Q8** | `socfpga.dtsi` `i2c1 clock-frequency` hunk: move into the board DTS instead of patching the shared SoC dtsi? | LOW | P1.7 |
| **Q9** | ~~DualSense (4 class-C commits)~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07-15)** at source level, no HW needed: the grouping was wrong (see corrected §3.4 rows) — `:player_id` carried (`0033`), lightbar superseded-better upstream, mute carried (`0037`). **"mute open (cosmetic)" was wrong — corrected 2026-07-20:** `BTN_Z` (`0x135`) shifts every higher gamepad button one index up in the `EV_KEY` bitmap, and Main_MiSTer resolves gamecontrollerdb `bN` indices off that bitmap; the shipped `platform:MiSTer` PS5 rows encode the BTN_Z-present layout (`guide:b11`). Dropping `0037` slides the whole DualSense map by one. On-device sanity check of `0033` still advisable at P3.13. | ~~LOW~~ done | ~~P3.13~~ |
| **Q10** | ~~Stock config 15 months older than fork HEAD~~ **RESOLVED (2026-07-15):** `CONFIG_MACVLAN=y` added and `CONFIG_JOYSTICK_XPAD` switched to `=m` in `linux.config` (both drifts closed); `HID_VADER4=m` was already carried via `0013`. Kernel-recon config axis now diffs against fork-HEAD `MiSTer_defconfig`. | ~~LOW~~ done | ~~P1.3~~ |

### Proposed additions to PLAN.md's A1–A9 index (for P0.9)

* **A10 — `/media/fat` is a kernel-mounted, `sync,dirsync,noatime,nodiratime`, UTF-8, *symlink-capable*
  filesystem.** Stock mounts FAT32 **and** exFAT through a single out-of-tree exfat driver that
  supports symlinks (`ATTR_SYSTEM` bit) and defaults to `iocharset=utf8`; nothing in
  `/etc/fstab` re-mounts it. Mainline exfat/vfat provide **neither** symlinks nor UTF-8 by
  default. Any replacement must reproduce mount flags, codepage **and** decide the symlink
  question. [N1, N3, §4] → P1.3, P1.10
* **A11 — The audio ABI is `/dev/MrAudio` + a patched `snd-dummy` glued by `/etc/asound.conf`.**
  Not a conventional ALSA driver. `CONFIG_SND_DUMMY=y` is mandatory; the `dummy.c` patch ships
  with `0002-…`; `/etc/asound.conf` ships in the rootfs overlay. [N4] → P1.5, P2.3
* **A12 — Main_MiSTer relies on mousedev receiving events while evdev is `EVIOCGRAB`-ed.**
  A core `drivers/input/input.c` + `mousedev.c` patch, not a HID quirk. [§6 `0026`] → P1.9
  **SATISFIED (P1.9-esc, [OPUS]): `0026-input-mousedev-eviocgrab.patch`.** A12 is sharper than
  it reads, and §9.1 states it exactly: Main_MiSTer's *primary* mouse data path is the ImPS/2
  packet stream from `/dev/input/mouseN`, and it `EVIOCGRAB`s that same mouse's **evdev** node
  whenever a core is running or the OSD is up. Without the patch the grab starves mousedev and
  **the mouse dies in every core.** Not a nicety — the difference between a working mouse and
  no mouse, for every user who owns one.

## 8. Reproducing this triage

`scripts/triage/regen-triage.sh` regenerates every number in §1 from scratch (downloads the
pristine tarball, verifies its hash, builds the blob-hash listings, and prints the added /
removed / modified counts plus the reconciliation). Text output only; nothing is committed.

Reference trees used (all under gitignored `work/`, see `docs/reference-materials.md`):

| Tree | Ref | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `work/linux-5.15.1/` | tarball, SHA-256 `32fdcd33…14c8` (kernel.org signed sums) | pristine baseline |

## 9. P1.9's three [OPUS] escalations — resolved

Owner: **P1.9-escalation** ([OPUS]). Done 2026-07-12 by Michael C. Ferguson, working tree
`work/k-esc/` (pristine 6.18.38). P1.9 ([SONNET]) correctly refused to force these three and
escalated per TASKS.md §0's escalation rule. Outcome: **two carried, one deliberately not.**

Verification for all of it: the full ordered series (**23 patches**, `0001`–`0030`) applies
clean to a pristine 6.18.38 with `git apply --check`, and a full
`make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf- zImage modules` with
`board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` produces **zero warnings and zero errors** (`zImage`
8,623,256 bytes + 42 modules). `input.o`, `mousedev.o`, `hid-nintendo.o` also rebuilt clean at
`W=1`. **No `linux.config` changes were needed** — see §9.4.

### 9.1 `0026-input-mousedev-eviocgrab.patch` — CARRIED. The one that mattered.

**This is not a peripheral quirk. On an unpatched 6.18, a USB mouse works in the file browser
and goes dead the moment you launch a core — for every user.** The mechanism, established by
reading Main_MiSTer rather than assuming:

* Main_MiSTer opens **both** node families for the same physical mouse: `/dev/input/eventN`
  *and* `/dev/input/mouseN` (`input.cpp:5177` — `readdir()` matching `"event*"` **and**
  `"mouse*"`).
* Its **primary** mouse data path is mousedev, not evdev: it writes the ImPS/2 magic sequence
  to the mouse node to enable the scroll wheel (`input.cpp:5237`) and then parses raw 4-byte
  PS/2 packets from it (`input.cpp:6144`). The evdev node is used for identification and for
  everything that is not the pointer.
* Whenever a core is running or the OSD is visible it `EVIOCGRAB`s **every** fd in its pool —
  which includes the evdev node of the very mouse whose mousedev node it is reading
  (`input.cpp:6463` `input_switch()`, `:5528` on hotplug).
* And `input_pass_values()` (`drivers/input/input.c:111`) short-circuits on `dev->grab`: a
  grabbed device delivers to the grabbing handle **and to nobody else**. `input_grab_device()`
  has exactly one caller in the tree — evdev. So the grab starves mousedev, and the pointer
  dies exactly when the user starts using the machine.

**What the patch changes, semantically — three things:**

1. **`include/linux/input.h` + `drivers/input/input.c`.** A new opt-in flag on
   `struct input_handler`, **`->ignore_grab`**. When a grab is in force, `input_pass_values()`
   delivers to the grabbing handle as before, and *then* makes a second pass over the device's
   open handles, delivering the same batch to any handler that set the flag. mousedev sets it;
   nothing else does. Deliberately narrow: exempt handlers see the batch **after** the grabbing
   handle (an evdev grab still wins; a filter that ate an event still hides it); their return
   value is **discarded** (an observer may not shorten the batch the autorepeat pass below
   uses); and with no grab in force **nothing changes at all** — the flag is read only on the
   `dev->grab` path.
   *Deviation from the fork, deliberate:* the original matches `strncmp(handle->name, "mouse", 5)`
   inside the input core. That works only because mousedev happens to name its handles
   `mouse%d`, it couples the core to a naming convention, and it puts a `strncmp()` in the event
   hot path. The flag says the same thing exactly (mousedev is the only handler with handles
   named `mouse*`), says it in the handler that wants the exemption, and costs a byte and a
   predictable branch. Note `struct input_handler` **already has** an unrelated
   `->passive_observer`; hence the different name.
2. **`drivers/input/mousedev.c` — `EVIOCGRAB` on mousedev itself.** mousedev has no
   `->unlocked_ioctl` in mainline, so Main_MiSTer's `EVIOCGRAB` on a mouse node returns
   `-ENOTTY` (it ignores the error) and the node is not actually exclusive. This gives mousedev
   evdev's grab semantics at the mousedev-*client* level: `EVIOCGRAB,1` → this client becomes
   the sole recipient of that mousedev's packets, `-EBUSY` if another client holds it;
   `EVIOCGRAB,0` → release, `-EINVAL` if not the holder; dropped automatically on `close()`, so
   a crashed client cannot wedge the node. The grab is **per-mousedev, not global**: grabbing
   `/dev/input/mouse0` does not silence `/dev/input/mice`, because `mousedev_event()` feeds the
   mixdev through a separate `mousedev_notify_readers()` call. Unknown ioctls return
   **`-ENOTTY`** (the original returned `-EINVAL`, a gratuitous ABI change for anything that
   probes the node).
3. **`drivers/input/mousedev.c` — tap-to-click suppression for DS4/DualSense.** mousedev
   synthesises a left-click when a touch is released within `tap_time`. A DualShock 4 /
   DualSense touchpad is used on MiSTer as a plain pointing device (Main_MiSTer `QUIRK_DS4TOUCH`
   reads it through that same mouse node), where the synthetic click is a misfire: lift a finger,
   get a spurious button-1. Suppressed for the four Sony IDs via a per-device `dis_t2c` flag.
   **Known gap, carried deliberately:** the DualSense **Edge (054c:0df2)** is not in the list
   because it is not in the original either (the Edge postdates it). An Edge used as a
   touchpad-mouse will still tap-to-click. Adding it is a one-line table change, but it is a
   behaviour change relative to stock MiSTer, not a forward-port. → **P3.13.**

**Forward-port work (5.15 → 6.18): the `input.c` hunk does not apply in any form.**
`input_to_handler()` no longer exists — `d469647bafd9` ("Input: simplify event handling logic",
Torokhov, 2024-07-03, v6.11) replaced it with a per-handle `->handle_events()` method bound at
registration by `input_handle_setup_event_handler()`; `071b24b54d2d` (v6.12) fixed where that
binding happens; and `21d8dd0daf4c` ("Input: use guard notation in input core", v6.14) turned
the RCU read section into a `scoped_guard(rcu)` block, so the grab fast path now exits with
`break`, not `rcu_read_unlock()` + return. Both hunks were rewritten against that structure.
`mousedev.c` itself is structurally unchanged since 5.15, so those hunks are near-mechanical —
but the ioctl, the `-ENOTTY` default, and the RCU annotations were rewritten to evdev's idiom
(`rcu_dereference_protected()` with an explicit `lockdep_is_held()`, not a bare `__rcu`
dereference).

**Not verifiable without hardware:** that a real mouse's pointer survives an `EVIOCGRAB` in a
running core, and that DS4/DualSense touchpads no longer emit phantom clicks. → **P3.13.**

### 9.2 `0015-hid-nintendo-nso-famicom.patch` — CARRIED. A re-implementation, not a rebase.

The NSO Famicom pair reports the **Joy-Con (R) product ID (057e:2007)** over Bluetooth, so it
already matches the driver's device table; what it does not report is a *controller type* the
driver knows — the device-info subcommand returns **0x07** (controller I) and **0x08**
(controller II). Every type helper in 6.18's `hid-nintendo.c` returns false for those, and
`joycon_read_info()` (`:2455`) stores the byte without validating it. Net effect on an
unmodified 6.18: **the pads probe successfully, create an input device, and register no buttons
and no axes at all** — a silent, dead gamepad, nothing in `dmesg`. This adds the two types and
wires them into the two dispatch chains.

P1.9 was right that this is not a diff replay. `94f18bb19945` ("HID: nintendo: add support for
nso controllers", Ryan McClelland, 2023-12-04) rewrote the driver's detection scheme, and
**every hunk of the original is obsolete:**

| Original (5.15 idiom) | 6.18 | Disposition of the hunk |
|---|---|---|
| `#define jc_type_is_nescon(ctlr)` — macros ANDing product ID with `ctlr_type` | tiered `static inline bool joycon_{device,type}_is_*()` helpers (`:658-767`); **type helpers test `ctlr_type` alone** — the product ID is deliberately no longer consulted, because NSO pads lie about it | rewritten: added `joycon_type_is_left_famicom()` / `joycon_type_is_right_famicom()` |
| `jc_type_is_joycon` taught to exclude Famicom (else a Famicom, reporting the Joy-Con (R) PID, is misdetected as a Joy-Con) | `joycon_type_is_any_joycon()` is type-based, already false for 0x07/0x08 | **dropped — not needed** |
| `jc_type_is_nso` roll-up gating a shared reporting block | no such helper; each type has its own arm in `joycon_parse_report()` / `joycon_input_create()` | **dropped**, replaced by two new arms |
| `jc_has_rumble` — a **negative** list (all except nescon/snescon/mdcon), had to learn about Famicom or the pads get a rumble device they do not have | `joycon_has_rumble()` / `_has_imu()` / `_has_joysticks()` are **positive** lists | **dropped — a new type is excluded from all three by construction.** This is the load-bearing insight: the negative→positive flip means new NSO types need *no* capability-helper edits at all |
| `famircon_button_inputs[]` — a flat array of `BTN_*` codes; the bit→code mapping open-coded in a long if/else | `struct joycon_ctlr_button_mapping` tables of `{code, bit}` pairs consumed by `joycon_config_buttons()` / `joycon_report_buttons()` | rewritten: authored `famicom_r_button_mappings[]` against the new structure, `JC_BTN_*` bits taken from the shared NSO decode block the original relied on (unchanged since 5.15) |

Controller I reuses `nescon_button_mappings` verbatim (it *is* a NES pad in a different shell).
Controller II gets its own four-entry table — A, B, and the two rail buttons — because it
physically has **no SELECT and no START** (on a real Famicom those live on controller I); in
their place it has a microphone and volume slider, which neither the original nor this port
exposes (the original's subject says so: *"no mic for Famicom R"*). Without an entry, the bit is
simply never reported, rather than a phantom SELECT/START being fabricated.

**Behaviour note, A/B — read this before filing a bug.** The original reports "A" as `BTN_EAST`
and "B" as `BTN_SOUTH` for all NSO controllers. Upstream 6.18 maps NES-family pads
**positionally** instead — "A" → `BTN_SOUTH`, "B" → `BTN_EAST` (`nescon_button_mappings`; cf.
the explicit *"mapped positionally, rather than by label"* comment on `gencon_button_mappings`).
This port follows **upstream's** convention, because Famicom controller I shares
`nescon_button_mappings` and the two pads of one set must not disagree with each other.
Consequence: **A and B are swapped relative to stock MiSTer** — but they are already swapped for
the NSO NES, SNES, N64 and Genesis pads too, which is a pre-existing consequence of taking
upstream's `hid-nintendo` instead of the fork's (§3.3, class C), not something this patch
introduces. Users re-map in the OSD.

**Not verifiable without hardware:** no NSO Famicom pair here. The type bytes, the button set,
and the absence of SELECT/START on controller II are taken from the original commit, whose
author has the hardware. → **P3.13.**

### 9.3 `0021-hid-lg4ff-g923.patch` — **NOT CARRIED.** Deliberate. No `00xx` file.

TASKS.md's standing bar for this one is *"a broken force-feedback wheel driver is worse than an
absent one"*. It is not carried, and the reasoning is below in full, because "we skipped it" is
not an acceptable answer on its own.

**First, two corrections to P1.9's analysis** (which was directionally right and wrong on the
facts):

* **`USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_G920_WHEEL` is NOT an orphaned ID.** P1.9 grepped only
  `hid-lg4ff.c` and `hid-lg.c`. It is referenced by **`hid-logitech-hidpp.c:4666`**
  (`HIDPP_QUIRK_CLASS_G920`, FF via HID++ feature page `0x8123`). More importantly, 6.18's
  `hid-ids.h:905` **already carries `USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_G923_XBOX_WHEEL` (0xc26e)** and
  `hid-logitech-hidpp.c:4669` binds it. **The G923 Xbox/PC variant is already fully supported
  upstream, force feedback included** — and `CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_HIDPP` is `=y` in our build
  (selected by `CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ`). There is nothing to do for it.
* **The "32-bit rumble/FF fix" fixes a bug that does not exist in 6.18.** The actual diff of
  `43c52e9ef` is `parameters[i].k1 = div_s64((long long)parameters[i].k1 * gain, 0xffff)` — a
  64-bit division in *gain-scaling code that exists only in the out-of-tree rewrite*. 6.18's
  `hid-lg4ff.c` has no `parameters`, no `k1`/`k2`, no gain scaling, no `div_s64`, no `hrtimer`
  (`grep -c` → 0 for all of them): FF scaling is done by `input_ff_memless` in the input core.
  So this is not a fix we are declining to carry — **there is nothing to fix.**

**What the fork's patch actually is.** `8a100f2ed` (+1,425/−540) replaces `hid-lg4ff.c`
wholesale with a vendored copy of **berarma/new-lg4ff**, an out-of-tree hrtimer-driven
memless-FF-slot-scheduler rewrite that **never landed upstream**. 6.18 is still the pre-2019
driver. Carrying the fork's patch means carrying that entire third-party driver as a kernel
patch — for *all* Logitech wheels, replacing well-maintained mainline code.

**Why the "scoped subset" TASKS.md hypothesised does not work.** The suggestion was to lift just
the G923 device ID + wheel table onto 6.18's existing architecture. That subset is genuinely
*correct* — and practically **useless**, which is a finding, not an excuse:

* The G923 **PlayStation/PC** edition boots in PS mode as **046d:c267** and stays there. The
  classic-mode PID **046d:c266** — the one that behaves like a G29 and the only one a wheel
  table entry would help — is **only ever reached by sending the wheel a vendor mode-switch
  command** (report ID `0x30`, payload `f8 09 07 01 01 00 00`; identically documented as the
  `usb_modeswitch -v 046d -p c267 -M 30f8090701010000` recipe the community used before drivers
  did it). A `lg4ff_devices[]` row for c266 alone is dead code on real hardware.
* Making it useful therefore requires the whole multimode/mode-switch path
  (`LG4FF_MODE_G923{,_PS}` bits, `lg4ff_alternate_modes[]`, `lg4ff_multimode_wheels[]`,
  `lg4ff_g923_ident_info` = `{modes, mask 0xff00, result 0x3800, real c266}`,
  `lg4ff_mode_switch_30_g923`, plus `lg4ff_send_cmd_with_id()` / `lg4ff_switch_from_ps_mode()`
  and a hook in `lg4ff_handle_multimode_wheel()`) — ~120 lines, hand-authored against the old
  architecture, which is exactly the work P1.9 flagged.

**And that path has a failure mode strictly worse than doing nothing.** `hid_generic_match()`
(`drivers/hid/hid-generic.c`) returns **false** if any other driver's `id_table` claims the
device. So the moment `c267` is added to `lg_devices[]`, hid-generic will not touch the wheel —
and if `lg4ff_init()` then hard-fails (`"this module does not know how to handle it"`,
`error = -1`, `hid-lg.c` `lg_probe()` → `goto err_stop`), the wheel ends up with **no driver
bound at all: no axes, no buttons, nothing.** In the reference implementation that hard-fail is
gated on an untestable magic `bcdDevice` value (`(bcdDevice & 0xff00) == 0x3800`). Today a G923
PS at least enumerates under hid-generic as a working joystick. **Shipping this could take that
away.** The hardening that removes the hazard (switch unconditionally on PID `c267`; restore the
mutated `report->id`; always return `LG4FF_MMODE_SWITCHED` so a failed switch degrades to
"joystick, no FF") is code that **has never run anywhere, on any wheel** — and the thing it
would be steering is a 2.5 Nm motor in someone's hands. That is not a standard this port is
willing to defend, and TASKS.md says so in as many words.

**So: what does a G923 owner actually get?**

| Variant | On stock MiSTer (5.15 + fork rewrite) | On this kernel (6.18, no `0021`) |
|---|---|---|
| **G923 Xbox/PC** (046d:c26d/**c26e**) | not handled by the fork's `lg4ff` either (HID++ device) | ✅ **fully supported, FF included** — upstream `hid-logitech-hidpp`. No change, no work. |
| **G923 PlayStation/PC** (046d:**c267** → c266) | FF, 900° range, auto-switch out of PS mode | ⚠️ **binds `hid-generic`: steering, pedals and buttons all work as a plain joystick. No force feedback. No range control.** This is the regression, and it is the whole of it. |
| **G29, G27, G25, DFP, DFGT, Momo, DF-EX, Wingman** | the out-of-tree rewrite | ✅ mainline `hid-lg4ff` — FF, range and mode-switching, all of it, from the maintained in-tree driver rather than a vendored fork. Arguably a **reliability gain.** |

**Recipe for whoever has the hardware** (this is 90% of the work, pre-verified — all magic
numbers cross-checked against **two** independent public sources, berarma/new-lg4ff master and
the `usb_modeswitch` recipe above, which agree byte-for-byte):

1. `hid-ids.h`: `USB_DEVICE_ID_LOGITECH_G923_WHEEL 0xc266`, `..._G923_PS_WHEEL 0xc267`
   (`..._G923_XBOX_WHEEL 0xc26e` is **already there**).
2. `hid-lg.c`: `lg_devices[]` rows for c266 + c267 with `LG_FF4`; c266/c267 in `lg_probe()`'s
   "interface 0 only" check; c266 in `lg_input_mapped()`'s wheel list.
3. `hid-lg4ff.c`: `lg4ff_devices[]` row
   `{c266, lg4ff_wheel_effects, 40, 900, lg4ff_set_range_g25}` — *identical to the G29's row;
   the struct is unchanged in 6.18* — plus the multimode/alternate-mode/ident/mode-switch
   entries listed above.
4. **Handle the hard-fail.** Do not let a `c267` device reach the `lg4ff_devices[]` lookup.
5. Test on the wheel. Then send it upstream: mainline has no G923-PS support at all, and this
   would be the first.

### 9.4 Kernel config

**No `board/mister/de10nano/linux.config` changes were required by any of the three.**
`CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y` and `CONFIG_HID_NINTENDO=y` are already present. `linux.config` is a
`savedefconfig`-style file, so symbols that are `select`ed or take their Kconfig default are
correctly absent from it — verified against the generated `.config` that
`CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_HIDPP=y` (selected by `CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ`) and `CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF=y`
(`default LOGITECH_FF`), so `hid-logitech-hidpp.o` and `hid-lg4ff.o` **are** built. That matters
for §9.3: the upstream G923-Xbox and G29-family wheel support is compiled in, not merely
available.

## 10. Latent bugs in the **stock** MiSTer kernel that this image fixes

These are **not** forward-porting regressions. Every one is present verbatim in the
5.15 fork and therefore in **every MiSTer image shipped to date**. They surfaced only
because forward-porting forces you to read code that has otherwise been copied
forward untouched since 2021.

They are listed here because they are **user-visible behavioural differences between
the stock 5.15 image and ours**, and belong in the release notes (P4.8/P4.9) as much
as in this triage.

| # | Patch | Bug in stock | Effect on a stock MiSTer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B1** | `0014-hid-gamecube-adapter` | **Use-after-free on unplug.** Teardown cancels only `adpt->work_rumble`; the four per-port `ctrl->work_connect` items are never cancelled, then `kfree(adpt)` runs. `work_connect` is embedded in `adpt->ctrls[]` and its handler `container_of()`s back and dereferences `ctrl->adpt->hdev` — and can even `input_register_device()` against the freed adapter. Same defect on the probe error path. | Plugging a controller into the GameCube adapter while the adapter itself is being unplugged can corrupt kernel memory. Silent; may present as an unrelated later crash. | **FIXED** (PR #2 review) |
| **B2** | `0001-fbdev-add-MiSTer_fb` | **`memremap()` returns `NULL` on failure, not an `ERR_PTR`** — the code tests `IS_ERR()`, which is *false* for NULL. A failed mapping therefore falls straight through with `screen_base` unset. | Oops on the first fbcon draw if the framebuffer window ever fails to map. Unreachable with a correct DT node, which is why it has never been seen. | **FIXED** (P1.4) |
| **B3** | `0002-sound-add-MiSTer-audio-spi` | **`class_create()`/`device_create()` return `ERR_PTR`, never `NULL`** — the `== NULL` checks are dead code, so a *failed* `device_create()` was treated as success. | Driver would continue as if `/dev/MrAudio` existed when it did not. | **FIXED** (P1.5) |
| **B4** | `0002-sound-add-MiSTer-audio-spi` | **Bogus diagnostics on SPI failure.** `device_open()` computes the ring `len` even when `spi_read()` failed: `rptr` stays `-1`, `-1 >> 8` is still `-1`, and the `(unsigned int)` cast makes it compare as `0xffffffff`, so the wraparound branch is *always* taken → `len = ptr + buffer_len + 1`, a length larger than the whole ring. | The status string you read to diagnose a broken SPI link is itself wrong — precisely when you need it. No memory-safety issue (`msg[]` is 1024 B; nothing in userland parses it). | **FIXED** (PR #2 review) |
| **B5** | `0019-hidpp-k400-fn-inversion` | The fork's own patch **reuses `SetFeature` at the wrong feature index** (shares a feature-index cache it should not). | Wrong HID++ feature written on a Logitech K400. | **FIXED** (P1.9) |
| **B6** | `0003-cpufreq-cyclone5-de10nano` | **`wait_for_fsm()` passes a *mask* where a *bit number* is expected.** `wait_on_bit(word, bit, mode)` is given `CLKMGR_STAT_BUSY` (`BIT(0)` == 1), so it polls **bit 1**, not bit 0. It also does a plain `test_bit()` on `__iomem` rather than `readl()`, and would sleep on a wait queue no hardware can wake if the bit were ever seen set. | Harmless *today* only because the call returns immediately. | **NOT FIXED — carried verbatim, deliberately.** Correcting it changes PLL transition timing, which cannot be validated without a bench. A forward-port is the wrong place to smuggle that in. **Tracked for P1.13 hardware bring-up.** |

### Why B6 is not fixed

The other five are fixes whose correctness can be established by reading the code.
B6 is not: making `wait_for_fsm()` actually *wait* changes the timing of a live PLL
reprogramming sequence on silicon we have not yet booted. Shipping an untested change
to clock sequencing — inside a patch whose stated job is "carry this forward" — is
exactly the kind of quiet scope creep that makes a forward-port unreviewable. It is
recorded, not hidden, and P1.13 has it on the checklist.

## 11. 2026-07-15 reconciliation corrections (summary)

The full per-commit reconciliation (`docs/kernel-recon/`, 123 records, 100%% tier-2 verified)
found **15 rows in this doc that failed independent re-derivation**; all are corrected inline
above (search "CORRECTED 2026-07-15" / "updated 2026-07-15"). The systemic failure mode was
**grouped rows**: a genuinely-upstream feature set absorbing fork-specific commits that then
got stamped with the group's disposition. Confirmed misclassifications, all now resolved:

| Commit | Was | Actually | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `45283785a` combo LED | Class C drop | fork-only, Main_MiSTer-coupled | carried `0032` |
| `f84543926`+`b76b4bc6a` player_id LED | Class C drop | fork-only, Main_MiSTer-coupled | carried `0033` |

New carried patches from these decisions: `0032`–`0037` (see `board/mister/de10nano/
linux-patches/`), each with full provenance headers.

### Patches added after the 2026-07-15 reconciliation

Five further patches landed on 2026-07-24 and are not dispositioned anywhere above. Each
carries a self-documenting provenance header; this doc only needs the row.

| Patch | Origin | Why carried |
|---|---|---|
| `0038-hid-nintendo-nso-genesis-bt-pid` | `b00a72159` (Shig) | stock-parity: forces the NSO Genesis pad's Bluetooth product ID from `ctlr_type` before the input_dev is created; without it the pad reports the SNES pad's `0x2017` and Main_MiSTer's gamecontrollerdb GUID lookup matches the wrong row |
| `0039-hid-nintendo-nso-n64-genesis-stock-button-mapping` | `b00a72159` (Shig) | mainline's NSO N64/Genesis tables assign different evdev codes than stock — A/B outright swapped on N64, three of four C-buttons moved, six of ten Genesis bits differ; every gamecontrollerdb `bN` index shifts |
| `0040-hid-nintendo-imu-name-suffix` | `a6b7e3666` (Sorgelig) | **RETIRED 2026-09-12 — slot intentionally empty.** Was: Main_MiSTer excludes the IMU input device with `strstr(name, " IMU")` and that string test is its only hook; mainline's `"%s (IMU)"` does not match, so the IMU node is opened as a phantom controller. Offered upstream as Linux-Kernel_MiSTer PR #96 alongside a userspace alternative; the maintainer closed the kernel PR ("better to follow mainline to be compatible with upstream kernel source") and merged Main_MiSTer #1307, which also matches `"(IMU)"`. Shipped in Main_MiSTer Release 20260912, so the kernel no longer needs to carry the name. The patch header's second consumer, SDL2's `SDL_strstr(name, " IMU")` filter, is *not* covered: an SDL2 program on this image now enumerates a Switch pad's `(IMU)` node as a second game controller — the same thing stock's own 6.18 kernel does, and nothing shipped uses SDL2's controller layer for it. |
| `0041-hid-nintendo-stock-led-classdev-names` | `60821059c` (Sorgelig) | **RETIRED 2026-09-12 — slot intentionally empty.** Was: stock `player1`-`player4`/`home` LED classdev names — Main_MiSTer opens these by exact path and treats a failed `fopen()` as a silent no-op, so under mainline's names every Switch controller loses userspace LED control (same origin commit as `0035`). Offered upstream as Linux-Kernel_MiSTer PR #97; closed ("we will use mainline version to be compatible with further updates") in favour of Main_MiSTer #1308, which falls back to `:green:player-1`..`-4` and `:blue:player-5` when the 5.15 paths are absent. Shipped in Release 20260912. `0035` (registration non-fatal) and `0032`'s `:combo` node are unaffected — `:combo` never had a mainline name to fall back to. |
| `0042-hid-playstation-stock-lightbar-led-names` | `f123647ef` (Sorgelig) | stock lightbar LED names (`:red`/`:green`/`:blue`) plus probe-time player-LED clear; without them both PlayStation pads lose lightbar colour control | Config parity: `CONFIG_MACVLAN=y`,
`CONFIG_JOYSTICK_XPAD=m`. All verified via full `linux-dirclean` rebuild.

### `0047` — the first BACKPORT, added 2026-08-24, **RETIRED 2026-09-21**

**Retired 2026-09-21 — slot intentionally empty.** `linux-6.18.53` took `ce21a5cf3d1f` as
stable backport `0f7f58ea6299` (autosel; the commit had no `Cc: stable`, so the "no `.y` bump
will bring it in" below was a prediction, and it was wrong). The fail-closed design did its
job: at `-F0` against pristine `v6.18.53` the hunk reports `Hunk #1 FAILED at 786`, with the
row already present at `btusb.c:803`. The patch was deleted from `linux-patches/` outright,
exactly as its `Upstream:` block said, and its record flipped to `dropped-upstream` — the
disposition the paragraph after the table refused while it was false, and the right one now
that the functionality is in the kernel we build. The rest of this section is kept as written.

Every patch above exists because mainline does **not** have the change. `0047` was the first
one that existed because mainline **did** — and the stable line we pin did not.

| Patch | Origin | Why carried |
|---|---|---|
| `0047-btusb-mercusys-ma530-2c4e-0115` | `ce21a5cf3d1f` (Hrvoje Nuic, mainline) — landed independently on the fork as `6332499e7` (Stanislav Ponomarev); in 6.18.y since `6.18.53` as `0f7f58ea6299` | **RETIRED 2026-09-21 — slot intentionally empty.** Was: adds USB `2c4e:0115` (Mercusys MA530 / MA550H, Realtek RTL8761BUV) to `btusb`'s `quirks_table`. Without the row the adapter binds no driver, never reaches `btrtl`, never loads `rtl8761bu_fw.bin`, and no `hci0` appears — every Bluetooth feature on the box is silently absent for a user who owns that dongle and no other |

The disposition that looks right and is not is `dropped-upstream`. That disposition asserts
the functionality is present in **the kernel we build**, and it is not: the commit first
released in **7.2**, and we pin **6.18.y**, which never received it — it carries no
`Cc: stable`, so no `.y` bump will bring it in. Checked by tag rather than inferred: absent
from `v6.18.38`, `v6.18.44`, `v6.18.45`, `v7.0` and `v7.1`; present in `v7.2-rc1` and `v7.2`.

Three consequences follow, and each is written down where the reader who needs it will be:

- **It is the one shared patch the RT/beta series omits.** `package/linux-rt/Config.in` pins
  7.2, which already has the ID. That omission is forced, not tidy: at `-F0` against a
  pristine `v7.2` the hunk reports `Hunk #1 FAILED at 786`, so listing it would break
  `make linux-rt` at patch time rather than apply harmlessly twice.
  (`board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches-beta/series` header; `docs/rt-beta-kernel.md` §2.)
- **It has an expiry date.** The day the stock kernel pin leaves `6.18.y` for 7.2 or newer,
  this patch is deleted outright — re-applying it would collide with the in-tree row. The
  patch's own `Upstream:` block says so in capitals.
- **It took number `0047`, not `0043`.** `0043`–`0046` are beta-local patches living only in
  `linux-patches-beta/`. One number means one patch across both directories, so the shared
  series now reads `0001`–`0042`, then `0047`.

Record: `docs/kernel-recon/records/6332499e7545499dc361d09af7b44b33f494fe5d.json`
(disposition `carried`, tier-2 re-derived from `git.kernel.org` rather than the GitHub mirror
the first pass used). Neither adapter was tested here — we own neither. The failure mode if
the contributors' testimony is wrong is a dongle that still does not bind; a device-ID row
cannot regress hardware that does not match it.

### Patches added/changed in the 2026-09 increment

Nine `MiSTer-v6.18` commits and one open PR landed between `6332499e7` and `c129b0fac`
(2026-09-08 through 2026-09-11), prompted by stock's first 6.18 release (Release 20260907) and
the regressions users found in it within four days. Full write-up:
`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09.md`; per-item evidence: `docs/kernel-recon/records/` (the
ten records this table summarizes) and the two Opus decision memos
(`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/memo-Q4-cpufreq.md`, `memo-Q9-aic8800.md`).

| Patch / delta | Origin | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `0048-hid-google-stadiaff-classic2usb-retrozord` (new, all 3 series) | `41c45f378e8f433b56c4da9b80edcdfd67fcebfb`, Porkchop Express, PR #91 | Two `hid_device_id` rows so the Stadia rumble driver claims the Classic2USB/Reflex Adapt (`16d0:1460`) and RetroZord (`1209:595a`) adapters. Main_MiSTer already special-cases exactly these two IDs six times (`input.cpp:52-53`, `:4176-4177`, NeGcon/Guncon paths at `:5101-5103`/`:5348-5350`/`:5495-5506`) — Main_MiSTer-coupled, must-not-drop-silently |
| `0049-hid-nintendo-8bitdo-adapter-skip-baudrate` (new, all 3 series) | `a14b5e8e1c9c23f71b5d4cc300a7dab3083e546f`, Michał Kopeć, **open PR #92** (carried ahead of merge, owner decision D3 — see `fork-sync.conf`) | The 8BitDo USB Wireless Adapter in Switch mode presents as a genuine `057e:2009` Pro Controller and reset-loops (17 re-enumerations, hardware-verified by the PR author) when hid-nintendo sends it `JC_USB_CMD_BAUDRATE_3M`; the fix reorders `joycon_read_info()` ahead of that command and skips it for 8BitDo's `E4:17:D8` OUI. "Gamepad unusable" class, 32 lines, applies clean on top of all eight patches this repo already carries on `hid-nintendo.c` |
| `0050-exfat-dir-readahead-plug` (new, **6.18 series only**) | `9854075c86455942c2ce57e0b7dc80e3e2c5b108`, Sorgelig (re-committed; original PR #88 by Giancarlo Erra, whose `Signed-off-by` is preserved in the patch header) | Wraps `exfat_dir_readahead()`'s `sb_breadahead()` loop in `blk_start_plug`/`blk_finish_plug`, matching the existing allocation-bitmap precedent (`fs/exfat/balloc.c`). Throughput fix for large directories — exactly the MiSTer file-browser workload. **Omitted from `linux-patches-beta/` and DE25**: 7.2.3's exFAT was already refactored to a shared `exfat_blk_readahead()` helper (mainline's own generalization of the same precedent) and the fork's 4-line hunk fails `-F0` against it (`2 out of 2 hunks FAILED`, reproduced) — the RT/DE25 kernels already have the behaviour under a different shape |
| `0017-xpad-mister-deltas`, delta 5 | `7c75b1b469e4dfd8bf59f9c28a25af16cddd2d9b`, Kasper Olesen | Adds `skip_8bitdo_init`, a default-**off** module parameter that skips the Xbox-360 vendor-init request for USB `2dc8:3106` only — an experimental A/B switch (the commit's own words, not a permanent quirk) for the reconnect failure tracked in fork issue #84. Zero behaviour change unless a user opts in |
| `0004-dts-de10nano-MiSTer`, OCRAM `flags-sram@f000` node | `59bcae8ebc53933bc4729af25ae5cd94ade1f756`, Kasper Olesen, PR #85 — **partial carry only**, see the Q4 decision note below | Reserves the last 4 KiB of OCRAM from the `mmio-sram` `gen_pool` (a child node with only `reg`, no `export`/`pool`/`protect-exec`, is excluded from the pool per `drivers/misc/sram.c`). The fork's stated rationale ("MiSTer keeps persistent flags there") does not verify against Main_MiSTer — those flags are in DDR at `0x1FFFF000` (`fpga_io.cpp:397,595`, `user_io.cpp:1336,1370`) — but the reservation is carried anyway as zero-cost allocation hygiene, and it becomes load-bearing if option B (§below) is ever adopted, since that driver's OCRAM allocator rejects any page outside `0xffff0000-0xffffefff` |
| `0001-fbdev-add-MiSTer_fb-driver`, read/write helper alignment | `ea2212221ad137cf26bf5caa7ad3dab7216435a6`, Takiiiiiiii, PR #83 | Switches `.fb_read`/`.fb_write` from `__FB_DEFAULT_IOMEM_OPS_RDWR` (`fb_io_read`/`fb_io_write`) to `__FB_DEFAULT_SYSMEM_OPS_RDWR` (`fb_sys_read`/`fb_sys_write`) and adds `select FB_SYSMEM_FOPS` beside the existing `select FB_IOMEM_FOPS` (owner decision D4). `mmap` is unchanged (`fb_io_mmap` — there is no sysmem mmap helper). Proven behaviourally identical on ARM (`mmiocpy` *is* `memcpy`, `arch/arm/lib/memcpy.S:56-66`); done purely to shrink the export diff against `MiSTer-v6.18`. Main_MiSTer never calls `read(2)`/`write(2)` on `/dev/fb0`, so zero production risk |

**Dropped-deliberate, no carry:** `aec7dc3aa` (Q1, `CONFIG_TUN` — duplicate of `5fcfae369`,
already `linux.config:175`), `33a0521fd` (Q2, `CONFIG_RTW88_8821AU` — already `linux.config:623`
since v10), `e6f377e7d` (Q7, defconfig update — entirely derived from Q2/Q3/Q4, no independent
content). **Not-evaluated:** `c129b0fac` (Q9, AIC8800 driver — owner decision D2, below).

#### Q4/Q9 decision note (owner, 2026-09-11)

**Q4 — cpufreq (`59bcae8eb`, "Port MiSTer CPUFreq to Linux 6.18 with opt-in turbo", #85).**
**Decision: A — keep `0003`.** The fork's port is a real engineering improvement (a CCF clock
provider, an OCRAM-resident PLL retune under `stop_machine` with `OUTRESETALL`, 12.5%-per-step
VCO ramping, bounded polling, rollback, and CCF rate-change notification so the A9 TWD local
timers stay correct) over `0003`'s direct-register-poke design — but it is 700 lines this repo
did not write, with zero hardware validation on our image, against `0003`, which is the only
cpufreq code ever observed running a MiSTer at 1.2 GHz, including on our own board on 6.18
(`docs/testlogs/p1-first-boot.md:118`). The single strongest reason: the one thing adopting the
fork's driver could change for users — the boost/`scaling_max_freq` sysfs contract — is already
**byte-identical** between the two drivers (see the correction two subsections above), so there
is no user-visible upside to trade against the risk. Full comparison, including the fork's own
listed open issues (a deliberate infinite-loop hang path relying on a watchdog Main_MiSTer never
opens; a latched permanent failure; a possible `-EBUSY`-forever if SD is main-PLL-sourced; an
unexplained OSD-movement report) and the hardware test script that would flip this decision:
`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/memo-Q4-cpufreq.md`. Tracked as a bench-gated follow-up, not
abandoned — `docs/kernel-recon/records/59bcae8ebc53933bc4729af25ae5cd94ade1f756.json`.

**Q9 — AIC8800 Wi-Fi/BT driver (`c129b0fac`, "Add AIC8800 WiFi/BT driver.").**
**Decision: D — defer** — **reversed 2026-09-10 → packaged.** The owner packaged the driver and
its firmware after Wave 3 as `package/aic8800` (driver + all six firmware variants from
`radxa-pkg/aic8800`, the same SDK snapshot stock vendored, built with radxa's kernel-API
patches); the ledger record is `carried-as-package`, and it is still a Buildroot package, never
an in-tree patch, exactly as the paragraph below requires. `docs/wifi-parity.md` §10.1 and
`memo-Q9-aic8800.md` §10 hold the reversal; what follows is the defer analysis as it stood.
**Source update (2026-09-30):** the active package now follows
`shenmintao/aic8800d80` at a commit pin; this paragraph records the original
radxa-based decision and is historical. The current package uses upstream's
`main` branch only, so `chip_mcu_id=1` devices remain unsupported.

The original radxa-based driver compiled and modposted clean for 32-bit ARM (the
`rtl8852cu`-class `__aeabi_uldivmod` trap does not recur here) and has zero USB-ID bind conflicts
against anything this repo already carries — but it is inert without roughly 60 firmware blobs
that stock's own Release 20260907 `firmware.tar.gz` ships **none** of, and the 139-file vendored
source tree carries no `LICENSE`, no `README`, and no SPDX tags outside one third-party file (85
files have a bare copyright line and no licence grant at all; two files are Apache-2.0, which is
GPL-2.0-only incompatible, though not compiled into the shipped `.ko`). Both blockers —
identifying the upstream vendor repo (the exact snapshot is stamped in `rwnx_version_gen.h`:
`RWNX_VERS_REV "1a4b0054d2M (master)"`, SDK `"6.4.3.0"`, `RELEASE_DATE "2026_0123_5f7be68d"`) and
its firmware distribution — are answerable without hardware; this is a "come back when the two
facts are known" defer, not a "chip we decline to support" decline. ADR 0016 already permits an
out-of-tree driver here on the same "mainline cannot drive this chip" ground `rtl8852cu-morrownr`
was accepted on, and would require a Buildroot kernel-module package — never an in-tree patch,
regardless of outcome, per that same policy. Full sweep — license table, firmware filename
inventory, the build result, the USB-ID overlap test, and the re-open trigger:
`docs/kernel-recon/fork-sync-2026-09/memo-Q9-aic8800.md`. Record:
`docs/kernel-recon/records/c129b0fac34ad5d613bbec3f59d6036775e41c83.json`.

### `0051` — the first REVERT, added 2026-09-14, **RETIRED 2026-09-26**

**Retired 2026-09-26 — slot intentionally empty.** `linux-6.18.54` reverted the same commit
itself: stable `8c3b2bf7f39c` (Sasha Levin, "Revert "perf annotate: Fix build with
NO_SLANG=1""). Pristine `v6.18.54`'s `tools/perf/util/hist.h` has no `al_addr` at all, and at
`-F0` the patch reports "Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected", which failed the
6.18.54 bump's build at `linux-6.18.54/.stamp_patched` (PR #208). Deleted from `linux-patches/`
exactly as planned, and its `NO_FORK_ORIGIN` entry left `docs/kernel-recon/reduce.py` with it.
The rest of this section is kept as written.

`0047` was carried because mainline had a change and our stable line did not (until `6.18.53`
took it and the patch retired). `0051` is the
opposite failure and a new shape for this series: our stable line took *half* of a change,
and the half it took does not compile.

| Patch | Origin | Why carried |
|---|---|---|
| `0051-perf-revert-no-slang-al-addr-stub-mismatch` | reverts `e97bd4417010c648acf9b1e509cfb77fc506e09e` ("perf annotate: Fix build with NO_SLANG=1", Namhyung Kim, committed to `linux-6.18.y` by Sasha Levin via AUTOSEL; cherry-pick of mainline `0e6c07a3c30cdc45`) | 6.18.52 took that commit but **not** the commit it repairs, mainline `ad83f3b7155db28e82de24dbaa1af2b8f5d972a3` ("perf c2c annotate: Start from the contention line", Tianyou Li). That commit is what adds the `u64 al_addr` parameter to the `HAVE_SLANG_SUPPORT` prototypes, to the real definitions in `ui/browsers/annotate.c` and to every call site, and what puts `#define NO_ADDR 0` inside the `#ifdef`; the fix moves that `#define` out and adds `al_addr` to the two `#else`-side inline stubs. With only the fix applied, the move has nothing to move and the stubs are the sole things in the tree that believe in `al_addr`, so `perf` cannot be built with `NO_SLANG=1` — which is the only way this image ever builds it |

**Why it reaches us at all.** Buildroot's `package/linux-tools/linux-tool-perf.mk.in` builds perf
out of the kernel tree the `linux` package just built, and line 68 forces `NO_NEWT=1 NO_SLANG=1`
whenever `BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_PERF_TUI` is unset. It is unset here (enabling it would pull
`slang` into the target image for a TUI nothing on a MiSTer uses), so `HAVE_SLANG_SUPPORT` is off
and the broken stubs are exactly what gets compiled. `BR2_PACKAGE_LINUX_TOOLS_PERF` is selected
unconditionally by `package/mister-userspace/Config.in` (T5 diagnostics), so this is not an
optional leg that can be switched off to dodge the problem: it failed `make all` outright, at
`linux-tools`, roughly 31 minutes into CI (run `34913787711`, job `104207140200`).

**The evidence that 6.18.52 is internally inconsistent**, rather than us mis-building it:

```
$ grep -rn 'NO_ADDR' tools/                       # linux-6.18.52
tools/perf/util/hist.h:712:#define NO_ADDR 0      # ... and that is the only line
```

Every declaration, every definition and every call site of `hist_entry__tui_annotate()` and
`__hist_entry__tui_annotate()` in 6.18.52 is at the pre-`ad83f3b7` arity — `util/hist.h`
lines 718 and 722 (the SLANG prototypes), `ui/browsers/annotate.c` lines 611, 1111, 1119 and 1122,
`ui/browsers/hists.c` line 2488, and `builtin-annotate.c` line 523. Only the two stubs at
`util/hist.h:748` and `:757` disagree.

**Not inferred — compiled.** The CI failure was reproduced on a host build of the pristine
6.18.52 tree using Buildroot's own perf flag set, giving the identical
`builtin-annotate.c:523:31: error: too few arguments to function 'hist_entry__tui_annotate';
expected 4, have 3` and `make` exit 2; with `0051` applied and nothing else changed, the same
command reaches `LINK perf`, exit 0. The patched `tools/perf/util/hist.h` is byte-identical to
pristine `v6.18.51`'s, which is the arity CI built green on every run up to the bump.

**Three consequences, each written where its reader is:**

- **It is the third shared patch the RT/beta and DE25 series omit, and the first one they omit
  because 7.x was never broken.** `0047` was excluded because 7.x already had the same mainline
  commit (retired 2026-09-21); `0050` because 7.x has mainline's own different fix; `0051` because 7.x took both halves
  of the change and is self-consistent — applying the revert there would strip a parameter its
  callers pass. Measured, not assumed: at `-F0` against pristine `v7.2.6`'s
  `tools/perf/util/hist.h`, `Hunk #1 FAILED at 700. Hunk #2 succeeded at 741 (offset 2 lines).
  1 out of 2 hunks FAILED`, exit 1. (`board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches-beta/series` header;
  `docs/rt-beta-kernel.md` §2; `board/mister/de25nano/linux-patches/README.md`. For DE25 it is
  moot twice over — that defconfig does not select `BR2_PACKAGE_MISTER_USERSPACE`, so nothing
  there builds perf.)
- **Its hunks are deliberately generated at `-U12`, not `-U3`.** That is the opposite of `449ce9a`
  ("kernel: trim patch 0032 context so it survives the 6.18.52 / 7.2.6 bumps") and intentionally
  so: `0032` is meant to survive bumps, `0051` is meant to *die* at the right one. The wide
  context pulls the two `HAVE_SLANG_SUPPORT` prototypes into hunk 1, so the day 6.18.y repairs
  itself, the patch stops applying and CI fails in the `linux-patch` step naming this file —
  instead of applying cleanly and failing twenty minutes later as a perf compile error nobody
  connects to it. Buildroot patches at `-F0`, so there is no fuzz to absorb the mismatch.
- **When it stops applying, DELETE it — do not re-anchor it.** Every retirement path (6.18.y
  backporting `ad83f3b7155db28e`, 6.18.y reverting `e97bd4417010`, or the pin leaving 6.18.y)
  presents as the same failed apply, and in all three the tree has become correct without us.
  Re-anchoring would re-break the build. This is the one patch in the series where "it does not
  apply" is not a reason to re-anchor — the general rule is the beta `series` header's, and this
  is its documented exception.

**Not a fork-sync item.** There is no `docs/kernel-recon/records/` entry for `0051` and there
should not be: that ledger reconciles commits on the MiSTer fork, and this defect is purely a
`linux-6.18.y` stable-tree one that stock has never encountered (stock does not build perf).

**A trap worth recording, because the obvious SHA is the wrong one.** `0e6c07a3`/`e97bd4417010` carries
`Fixes: cd3466cd2639783d ("perf c2c: Add annotation support to perf c2c report")`, and that commit is
**not** the missing prerequisite: it touches only `Documentation/perf-c2c.txt` and `builtin-c2c.c`, never
`hist.h`, and the single annotate call it adds uses the three-argument form. `al_addr` and `NO_ADDR` come
from its immediate follow-up in the same series, `ad83f3b7155db28e`. The skip is surgically narrow: 6.18.y
took `f06ba25ec54a` ("perf annotate: Rename to `__hist_entry__tui_annotate()`"), the commit immediately
*before* `ad83f3b7`, and `0e6c07a3`, the commit immediately *after* it — the one before and the one after,
and only the middle one missing. Anyone re-deriving this from the `Fixes:` line alone will conclude the
prerequisite is present and be wrong.

**It will not self-heal at the next bump — checked, not assumed (2026-09-14).** `linux-6.18.y`
HEAD, which is what 6.18.53 gets cut from, still carries the broken shape: `tools/perf/util/hist.h`
has `NO_ADDR` at `:712` and `al_addr` on the two stubs at `:752`/`:760`, while
`builtin-annotate.c:523` still calls the three-argument form. Nothing in `stable-queue.git`'s
`queue-6.18` (567 patches at the time of writing) touches perf annotate, c2c or `hist.h`. That is
not surprising: the defect is invisible to nearly everyone who builds perf, because distributions
build it **with** slang and only `NO_SLANG=1` consumers — Buildroot, Yocto, embedded integrators —
compile the `#else` branch at all. So this patch should be expected to live for several point
releases, not one. It costs nothing to keep: it is a two-line arity revert of dead code, and by
construction it stops applying the moment 6.18.y repairs itself (see the `-U12` note above), so the
bump PR reports the retirement rather than us having to watch for it.

**Worth reporting upstream, not yet reported.** `stable@vger.kernel.org` would want to know that
`e97bd4417010` was picked into 6.18.y without `ad83f3b7155db28e`; the fix there is theirs to pick
(revert, or take the prerequisite). Not sent — sending it is an owner decision, like every other
outbound contribution in this repo.

### `0054`–`0066` — original dwc2 host work, added 2026-09-25 (#205)

Not from the fork and not backports: original patches by the repo owner against mainline
`drivers/usb/dwc2`, written to cut the host port's interrupt load. Carried in the de10nano
series and, by symlink, the beta series; not in de25nano. Each patch's header carries its
rationale and `Fixes:` tag; the per-patch table, measurements, the closed descriptor-DMA-with-splits
question and the options ledger are in [`dwc2-usb-irq.md`](dwc2-usb-irq.md). None has been
sent upstream yet (owner decision, after rig soak). Parked patches and lab-only
instrumentation from the same work live in [`dwc2-usb-irq/`](dwc2-usb-irq/README.md) and are not applied.

### Provenance note

B1 and B4 were **found by automated static review on PR #2**, not by the porting
agents. Both were confirmed against the 5.15 source before being fixed. This is worth
recording as evidence for the review discipline itself: the ports were already
building warning-free and passing every acceptance check when these were caught.

## 12. 2026-07-18 two-series update — Class B is carried, not dropped, for the exported tree

Every disposition in §3–§4 is, and always has been, about **the image Buildroot builds**.
That scope was implicit for the whole life of this doc because there was only one tree to
talk about: this repo built one kernel, and `scripts/export-kernel-tree.sh` (which renders
that kernel as a standalone `Linux-Kernel_MiSTer`-style branch for PR #75) replayed exactly
the same patches. "Delete" and "carried" meant the same thing whichever tree you looked at.

That stopped being true the day this repo started publishing the export upstream.
`MiSTer-devel/Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` is the kernel for **every** MiSTer, not just the one this
repo builds, and it needs at least one thing our image deliberately does not: `3d95de58f`
("Support for init loop device", Class B, §3.2/§4). That commit adds the `loop=` boot
parameter — the mechanism **every stock MiSTer boots through**, mounting the SD card's
data partition and loop-mounting `linux/linux.img` from it as root. A published
`Linux-Kernel_MiSTer` branch without it would not boot on any device but this repo's own.
Our image replaced the same job with a real initramfs `/init` (§4 verdict, unchanged by
this update), so the kernel *we* ship has no use for the in-kernel version — but the kernel
*upstream* ships cannot boot without it.

Neither "leave it out of the export, to keep saying the two trees are identical" nor "apply
it to our image, to keep saying there's only one patch series" is the right trade. So there
are now two:

| Series | Applied to our image (Buildroot) | Applied to the exported tree (`scripts/export-kernel-tree.sh`) |
|---|---|---|
| `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches/` (unchanged — everything in §3/§5 above) | yes | yes |
| `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches-upstream/` (new) | **no** — `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH` never points here | yes, replayed with `git am` immediately after the carried series |

`3d95de58f` is the first, and as of this writing only, patch in the new directory —
forward-ported to 6.18 and carried at
`board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches-upstream/0100-init-support-for-init-loop-device.patch`.
Its Class B row and §4's verdict above are corrected in place to say "from our image", not
just "deleted", to match.

`docs/kernel-recon/reconciliation.md` gained a matching disposition for this,
`carried-upstream-only` — distinct from `carried` (in our image) and from
`dropped-deliberate` (in **neither** series; §3's other Class-B-shaped rows, like the
`MiSTer_defconfig` commits absorbed into `linux.config`, are still exactly that). See that
doc's "The one `carried-upstream-only` row" for the full cross-reference.

This doc does not restate the mechanics of the new directory or the export script — both
are self-documenting and would drift out of sync with a third copy of the same rules here:

- **What belongs in the new directory, and what must never** — numbering (`0100` up, a
  separate namespace from `0001`–`0053` above), the mandatory reason a patch is absent from
  the image, provenance-header format: `board/mister/de10nano/linux-patches-upstream/README.md`.
- **How the export applies it, and what it prints** — `scripts/export-kernel-tree.sh`'s
  "TWO SERIES" header comment, and the table the script generates in `EXPORT.md` naming
  every upstream-only patch and why the image does not apply it. That table is the
  authoritative, current list — this section names the first entry, not a ceiling.
